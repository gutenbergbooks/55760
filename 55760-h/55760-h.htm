<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE MAN WHO COULD HAVE ENDED THE WAR
</h3>

<p>
It was a few minutes after one o'clock&mdash;the
busiest hour of the day at the most
popular bar in London.  The usual little throng
of Americans, journalists, men of business and
loiterers, were occupying their accustomed chairs
in one corner of the long, green-carpeted room.
Around the bar, would-be customers were
crowded three or four deep&mdash;many of them
stalwart Canadians in khaki, making the most
of their three days' leave, and a thin sprinkling
of men about town on their way to lunch in
the grill-room adjoining.  On the outskirts of
the group was a somewhat incongruous figure,
a rather under-sized, ill-dressed, bespectacled
little man, neither young nor old, colourless,
with a stoop which was almost a deformity.
His fingers were stained to the tip of his nails
as though by chemicals or tobacco juice.  He
held the glass of vermouth which he had just
succeeded in obtaining from the bar, half-way
suspended to his lips.  He was listening to the
conversation around him.
</p>

<p>
'The most blackguardly trick that has
ever been known in civilized warfare!' a
Canadian officer declared indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'It's put the lid on all pretence of conducting
this war decently,' another assented.  'What
about the Hague Convention?'
</p>

<p>
'The Hague Convention!' a young journalist
from the other side repeated sarcastically.
'I should like to know when Germany has
ever shown the slightest regard for the Hague
Convention or any other agreement which
didn't happen to suit her!'
</p>

<p>
The little man on the outskirts of the group,
who had been listening eagerly to the
conversation, ventured upon a question.  His accent
at once betrayed his transatlantic origin.
</p>

<p>
'Say, is there anything fresh this morning?'
he inquired.  'I haven't seen the papers yet.'
</p>

<p>
The Canadian glanced down at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
'We were talking,' he said, 'about the use
of poisonous gases by the Germans.  They
started pumping them at us yesterday and
pretty nearly cleared us out of Ypres.'
</p>

<p>
The effect of this statement upon the little
man was, in its way, extraordinary.  For a
moment he stood with his mouth open, the glass
shaking between his fingers, a queer, set
expression in his pale face.  Then his lips
parted and he began to laugh.  It was a mirth
so obviously ill-timed, so absolutely unaccountable,
that they all turned and stared at him.
There was no doubt whatever that for some
reason or other the news which he had just heard
had excited this strange little person almost
hysterically.  His lips grew further apart, the
whole of his face was puckered up in little creases.
Then, just as suddenly as his extraordinary
impulse towards mirth had come, it seemed
to pass away.  He drained his glass, set it
down on the edge of the counter, and, turning
around, walked slowly out of the place.  The
remarks that followed him were not altogether
inaudible and they were distinctly uncomplimentary.
</p>

<p>
'All I could do to keep my toe off the little
devil!' the Canadian exclaimed angrily.  'I'd
like to take him back with me out into the
trenches for a few days!'
</p>

<p>
A young man who had been talking to an
English officer on the outskirts of the group,
turned around.  He was a tall, well-set-up
young man, with a face rather grave for his
years and a mouth a little over-firm.  He,
too, had watched the exit of the stranger half
in indignation, half in contempt.
</p>

<p>
'Who was that extraordinary little man?'
he inquired.
</p>

<p>
No one seemed to know.  The waiter paused
with a tray full of glasses.
</p>

<p>
'He's staying in the hotel&mdash;arrived yesterday
from America, sir,' he announced.  'I don't
know his name, but I think he's a little queer
in his head.'
</p>

<p>
The young man set down his glass upon the
counter.
</p>

<p>
'A person,' he remarked, 'who can laugh
at such a ghastly thing, must be either very
queer in his head indeed, or&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Or what, Ambrose?' his companion asked.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' the other replied thoughtfully.
'Well, <i>au revoir</i>, you fellows!  I'm
going in to lunch.  Sure you won't come with
me, Reggie?'
</p>

<p>
'Sorry, I have to be back in ten minutes,'
the other replied.  'See you to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
Ambrose Lavendale strolled out of the room,
crossed the smoke-room and descended into
the restaurant.  At a table in a remote corner,
seated by himself, the little man who had
been guilty of such a breach of good-feeling
was studying the menu with a waiter by his
side.  Lavendale watched him for a moment
curiously.  Then he turned to speak to one
of the <i>maîtres d'hôtel</i>, a short, dark man with
a closely-cropped black moustache.
</p>

<p>
'I shan't want my usual table this morning,
Jules,' he announced.  'I am going to sit in
that corner.'
</p>

<p>
He indicated a vacant table close to the little
man whom he had been watching.  The <i>maîtres
d'hôtel</i> bowed and ushered him towards it.
</p>

<p>
'Just as you like, Mr. Lavendale,' he said.
'It isn't often you care about this side of the
room, though.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale seated himself at the table he
had selected, gave a brief order, and, leaning
back, glanced around him.  The little man
had sent for a newspaper and was reading it
eagerly, but for a moment Lavendale's interest
was attracted elsewhere.  At the very next
table, also alone, also reading a newspaper,
was the most striking-looking young woman
he had ever seen in his life.  Lavendale was
neither susceptible nor imaginative.  He
considered himself a practical, hard-headed person,
notwithstanding the fact that he had embraced
what was for his country practically a new
profession.  Nevertheless, he was conscious of
what almost amounted to a new interest in
life as he studied, a little too eagerly, perhaps,
the girl's features.  She was dark, with hair
brushed plainly back from a somewhat high
and beautifully shaped forehead.  Her
complexion was pale, her eyes a deep shade of soft
brown.  Her eyebrows were almost Japanese,
fine and silky yet intensely dark.  Her mouth,
even in repose, seemed full of curves.  She
appeared to be of medium height and she was
undoubtedly graceful, and what made her more
interesting still to Lavendale was the fact
that, although her manner of doing so was
stealthy, she, too, was watching the little
man who was now commencing his luncheon.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale, after a few moments' reflection,
adopted the obvious course.  He summoned
Jules and inquired the young lady's name.
The man was able at once to give him the
desired information.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne, sir,' he whispered discreetly.
'She is a writer, I believe.  I am not quite
sure,' the man added, 'whether she is not
the agent over here of some French dramatists.
I have seen her sometimes with theatrical
parties.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded and settled down rather
ineffectively to his lunch.  Before he had
finished he had arrived at two conclusions.
The first was that Miss de Freyne, although
obviously not for the same reason, was as much
interested in the stranger as he was; and
the second that his first impressions concerning
her personality were, if anything, too weak.
He ransacked his memory for the names of
all the theatrical people whom he knew, and
made mental notes of them.  It was his firm
intention to make her acquaintance before the
day was over.  Once their eyes met, and,
notwithstanding a reasonable amount of <i>savoir
faire</i>, for the moment he was almost embarrassed.
He found it impossible to glance away, and
she returned a regard which he felt in a way
was semi-committal, with a queer sort of
nonchalant interest in a sense provocative,
although it contained nothing of invitation.
At the end of the meal Lavendale had come
to a decision.  He signed his bill, rose from
his place and approached the table at which
the little man was seated.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' he said, 'I am a stranger to you, but
I should like, if I may, to ask you a question.'
</p>

<p>
Even in that moment's pause, when the
little man laid down his newspaper and was
staring up at his questioner in manifest
surprise, Lavendale felt that his proceeding had
attracted the strongest interest from the young
woman seated only a few feet away.  She
had leaned ever so slightly forward.  A coffee
cup with which she had been toying had been
noiselessly returned to its saucer.  It was
genuine interest, this, not curiosity.
</p>

<p>
'Say, how's that?' the little man exclaimed.
'Ask me a question?  Why, I don't know
as there'd be any harm in that.  I'm not
promising that I'll answer it.'
</p>

<p>
'I was in the bar a moment ago,' Lavendale
continued, 'when they were talking of these
poisonous gases which the Germans are using.
I heard you ask a question and I heard the
answer.  You were apparently for the first
time informed of this new practice of theirs.
Will you tell me why, when you heard of it,
you laughed?'
</p>

<p>
The little man nodded his head slowly as
though in response to some thought.
</p>

<p>
'Sit down, young fellow,' he invited.  'Are
you an American?'
</p>

<p>
'I am,' Lavendale admitted.  'My name
is Ambrose Lavendale and I was attached to
the Embassy here until last August.'
</p>

<p>
'That so?' the other replied with some
interest.  'Well, mine's Hurn.  I don't know
a soul in London and you may be useful to
me, so if you like I'll answer your
question.  You thought my laugh abominable, I
guess?'
</p>

<p>
'I did,' Lavendale assented,&mdash;'we all did.
I dare say you heard some of the comments
that followed you out!'
</p>

<p>
'It was a selfish laugh, perhaps,' the little
man continued thoughtfully, 'but it was not
an inhuman one.  Now, sir, I will answer
your question.  I will tell you what that piece
of information which I heard at the bar, and
which I find in the paper here, means to me
and means to the world.  Hold tight, young
man.  I am going to make a statement which,
if you are sensible enough to believe it, will
take your breath away.  If you don't, you'll
think I'm a lunatic.  Are you ready?'
</p>

<p>
'Go ahead,' Lavendale invited.  'I guess
my nerves are in pretty good order.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn laid the flat of his hand upon the
table and looked upwards at his companion.
He spoke very slowly and very distinctly.
</p>

<p>
'I can stop the war,' he declared.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale smiled at him incredulously&mdash;the
man was mad!
</p>

<p>
'Really?' he exclaimed.  'Well, you'll be
the greatest benefactor the world has ever
known, if you can.'
</p>

<p>
The little man, who had arrived at the final
stage of his luncheon, helped himself to another
pat of butter.
</p>

<p>
'You don't believe me, of course,' he said,
'yet it happens that I am speaking the truth.
You are thinking, I guess, that I am a pitifully
insignificant little unit in this great city, in
this raging world.  Yet I have spoken the
solid truth.  I can stop the war, and, if you
like, you can help me.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale withdrew his eyes from his new
acquaintance's face for a moment and glanced
towards the girl.  Something that was almost a
smile of mutual understanding flashed between
them.  Doubtless she had overheard some part
of their conversation.  Lavendale raised his
voice a little in order that she might hear more.
He felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought that
they were establishing a mutual confidence.
</p>

<p>
'I'll help, of course,' he promised.  'In
what direction are your efforts to be made?'
</p>

<p>
The little man paused in the act of drinking
a glass of water, squinted at his questioner, and
set the tumbler down empty.
</p>

<p>
'Wondering what sort of a crank you've got
hold of, eh?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale began to be impressed.  The little
man did not look in the least like a lunatic.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it's rather a sweeping proposition,
yours,' Lavendale remarked.
</p>

<p>
'Everything in the world,' the other reminded
him didactically, 'was impossible before it
was done.  Your help needn't be very strenuous.
I guess there's some sort of headquarters
in London from which this war is run, eh?'
</p>

<p>
'There's the War Office,' Lavendale explained.
</p>

<p>
'Know any one there?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I know a good many soldiers who have
jobs there just now.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I guess you can help by saving me
time.  Do you happen to be acquainted with
any one in the Ordnance Department?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale reflected for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I know a man there,' he admitted.
'It's just as well to warn you, though, that
they're absolutely fed up with trying new shells
and powder.'
</p>

<p>
The little man smiled&mdash;a queer, reflective
smile, filled with some quality of self-appreciation
which seemed at once to lift him above
the whole world of crazy inventors.
</p>

<p>
'Your friend there now,' he asked, 'or will
he be taking his British two hours for lunch?'
</p>

<p>
'He never leaves the building after he gets
there in the morning,' Lavendale replied.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Daniel H. Hurn signed his bill and laid
down an insignificant tip.
</p>

<p>
'You through with your luncheon?' he
inquired.  'Right!  Then what about taking
me along and letting me have a word with
your friend?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't mind,' Lavendale agreed, a little
doubtfully, 'but he hasn't very much influence.'
</p>

<p>
Again the other smiled, and again Lavendale
was impressed by that mysterious contortion.
He glanced towards the adjoining table.  The
girl was still watching them closely.  Jules,
whom she had apparently just summoned,
was standing by her side, and Lavendale was
convinced that the questions which she was
obviously asking, referred to him.  He left
the room with reluctance and followed his
companion through the hall and into a taxi.
</p>

<p>
'Not sure whether I told you,' the latter
remarked, as he seated himself, 'that my
name is Hurn&mdash;Daniel H. Hurn&mdash;and I come
from way out west.'
</p>

<p>
'Glad to meet you, Mr. Hurn,' Lavendale
murmured mechanically.  'You are not taking
anything with you to show the people at the
War Office, then?'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Not necessary,' he answered.  'Bring me
face to face with a live man&mdash;that's all I need,
that's all you need to end the war.'
</p>

<p>
'I am an American,' Lavendale reminded him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn glanced at his companion curiously.
Lavendale, dressed by an English tailor and
at home in most of the capitals of Europe,
was an unfamiliar type.
</p>

<p>
'Shouldn't have thought it,' he admitted.
'This the place?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded and paid for the taxi
without any protest from his companion, whom
he piloted down many corridors until they
reached a room in the rear of the building.  A
boy scout guarded the door.  He stood on one
side to let Lavendale pass, but glanced at his
companion questioningly.
</p>

<p>
'Would you mind waiting here just for a
moment?' Lavendale suggested.  'My friend
is in this room, working with several other men.
It would be better for me to have a word with
him first.'
</p>

<p>
'Sure!' the other agreed.  'You run the
show.  I'll wait.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale entered the apartment and
approached the desk before which his friend
was sitting.
</p>

<p>
'Hullo, Reggie!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The young man, who was hard at work,
looked up from a sheaf of papers and held out
his left hand.
</p>

<p>
'How are you, Ambrose?  Sit down by the
side of me, if you want to talk.  We're up to
the eyes here.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale leaned over the desk.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, old chap,' he went on, 'I've
come on a sort of fool's errand, perhaps.  I've
got a little American outside.  He's a most
unholy-looking object, but he wants a word
with some one in the Ordnance Department.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill shook his head reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'Is this quite fair?' he protested.  'We've
had our morning dose of cranks already.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm sorry,' Lavendale said, 'but you've got
to deal with one more.'
</p>

<p>
'Know anything about him?'
</p>

<p>
'Not a thing,' Lavendale admitted.  'I've
talked to him for five minutes, and I have just
an idea that you ought to hear what he has to
say.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill laid down a paperweight upon his
documents.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, old fellow,' he said, 'I'll take
your little pal round to Bembridge, if you say
the word, but I warn you, he is as fed up as
I am and he'll be pretty short with him.'
</p>

<p>
'I shouldn't think my man was sensitive,'
Lavendale observed.  'Anyhow, my trouble's
over if you'll do that.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill sighed and closed his desk.
</p>

<p>
'This way, then.'
</p>

<p>
They passed out of the room to where
Mr. Daniel H. Hurn was waiting.  Merrill seemed
a little taken aback as Lavendale briefly
introduced them, and his glance towards his friend
was significant.  However, he led them both
down the corridor and knocked at a door at the
further end.
</p>

<p>
'Is the General disengaged?' he asked the
orderly who opened it.
</p>

<p>
They were immediately ushered in.  Two
clerks were seated at a great round table,
apparently copying plans.  There were models in
the room of every form of modern warfare.
A tall, thin man in the uniform of a General,
was examining some new pattern of hand grenade
as they entered.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' Merrill began, addressing him apologetically,
'my friend here, Mr. Ambrose Lavendale,
who was in the American Embassy for some
time, has brought Mr. Daniel Hurn of Chicago
to have a word with you.'
</p>

<p>
The General dropped his eyeglass and sighed.
</p>

<p>
'An invention?' he asked patiently.
</p>

<p>
'Something of the sort,' Mr. Hurn admitted
briskly.  'Do I understand that you are a
General in the British Army?'
</p>

<p>
'I am, sir,' General Bembridge admitted.
</p>

<p>
'Very well, then,' Mr. Hurn proceeded, 'I
am here to tell you this&mdash;I can end your war.
When you're through with smiling at me, you'll
probably say 'Prove it.'  I will prove it.
There's a row of taxicabs down below.  Take
me outside this city of yours to where there's
a garden and a field beyond.  Afterwards we'll
talk business.  You'll want to, right enough.
It'll take about an hour of your time&mdash;and I
can end the war!'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  The two
clerks who had been writing at the table, had
turned around.  General Bembridge was looking
a little curiously at his unusual visitor.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Hurn,' he said, 'I will be frank with you.
The average number of visitors who present
themselves here during the day with devices
which will end the war, is twenty.  To-day that
average has been exceeded.  I have already
spoken to twenty-four.  You make, you see,
the twenty-fifth.  If we were to go out in
taxicabs and watch experiments with every
one of them&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Pshaw!  I'm not one of those cranks,' Mr. Hurn
interrupted.  'Read this.'
</p>

<p>
He handed a half sheet of notepaper across
to the General, who adjusted his eyeglass and
read.  The heading at the top of the notepaper
was '<i>The Chicago School of Chemical Research</i>'
and its contents were brief:
</p>

<p class="quote">
'<i>Mr. Daniel H. Hurn is a distinguished
member of this society.  We recommend the
attention of the British War Office to any
suggestion he may make.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Here's another,' Mr. Hurn went on.  'This
is from the greatest firm of steel producers in
the world&mdash;kind of personal.'
</p>

<p>
General Bembridge glanced at the historic
name which recommended Mr. Hurn to the
consideration of the Government.  Then he sighed.
</p>

<p>
'I am going to-morrow morning at ten o'clock,'
he said, 'to inspect a battery at Hatton Park,
three miles from Hatfield, on the road to
Baldock.  You can meet me at the lodge gate at
a quarter to ten and I will give you a quarter
of an hour.'
</p>

<p>
'This afternoon would have been better,'
Mr. Hurn observed, buttoning up the letters
in his coat, 'but to-morrow morning it shall be.'
</p>

<p>
The General waved them away.  Merrill
glanced curiously at the American as the three
men walked down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
'Those letters did the trick,' he remarked.
'Forgive me if I hurry, Lavendale.  Don't let
your friend be a minute late to-morrow morning
or he'll lose his chance.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll see to that,' Mr. Hurn promised.  'Guess
I can hire some sort of an automobile to take
me out there.  Good morning, Captain Merrill,'
he added, by way of parting salute, holding out
his curiously stained hand.  'I am much obliged
to you for your help, and you can sleep to-night
feeling you've done more than any man in this
great building to save your country.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill winked at Lavendale as he disappeared
within his room.  The latter, with the inventor
by his side, stepped out into the street.
</p>

<p>
'About going down there to-morrow morning&mdash;&mdash;'
he began.
</p>

<p>
'Young man,' Mr. Hurn interrupted impressively,
'you've done your best for me and it's
only right you should have your reward.  You
may accompany me to this place, wherever it is.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale laughed softly, a laugh which his
companion absolutely failed to understand.
</p>

<p>
'All right,' he agreed, 'I'll take you down
in my car.  I'll be at the hotel at nine o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
'At five minutes to ten, if the General is
punctual,' Mr. Hurn promised, 'you shall see
the most wonderful sight you have ever
witnessed in your life.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Punctually at nine o'clock on the following
morning, Lavendale brought his car to a
standstill before the front door of the Milan Hotel.
Mr. Hurn, looking, if possible, shabbier and
more insignificant than ever, was waiting under
the portico.  He clambered at once to the
seat by Lavendale's side.
</p>

<p>
'Haven't you any apparatus to bring, or
anything?' the latter inquired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn smiled.
</p>

<p>
'Not a darned thing!'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
'You mean you're ready to start with your
experiment, just as you are, like this?'
</p>

<p>
'Sure!' the little man answered, 'and you'd
better get her going.'
</p>

<p>
They started off in silence.  Once more Lavendale,
as he glanced at the shabby little object
by his side, began to lose confidence.  As they
swung round into Golder's Green he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'What sort of a show are you going to give
us?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
'You'll know inside of an hour,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale frowned.  His protégé's appearance
that morning was certainly not prepossessing.
His collar showed distinct traces of its
vicissitudes upon the previous day.  His ugly,
discoloured hands were ungloved; his boots
were of some dull, indescribable material which
seemed to have escaped the attentions of the
valet; his flannel shirt was of the style and
pattern displayed in Strand establishments
which cater for the unæsthetic.  He had
discarded his hat for a black cloth cap and he had
developed a habit of muttering to himself.
Lavendale pressed the accelerator of his car
and increased its pace.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose I've made a fool of myself,' he
muttered.
</p>

<p>
They reached the open country and drew
up in due time before the lodge gates of what
seemed to be a very large estate.  There was
no sign as yet of the General.  Mr. Hurn
descended briskly and at once embarked upon
a survey of the neighbourhood.  Lavendale
lit a cigarette and paused to watch the approach
of a great limousine car rushing up the hill.
It passed them in a cloud of dust,&mdash;he stood
staring after it.  Notwithstanding the closed
windows, he had caught a glimpse of a face,
of eyes gazing with strained intentness out on
to his side of the road&mdash;the face of a woman
convulsed with urgency&mdash;the woman who had
played such queer havoc with his thoughts.
Almost at the same moment there was a rasping
voice in his ear.
</p>

<p>
'Say, Mr. Lavendale, there's just one thing
I ought to have warned you people about,
you don't want any spectators to this show.
There ain't no one on this earth has seen what
you are going to see.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was conscious of a queer flash of
premonition.  They three&mdash;the girl, the crazy
little American and he himself&mdash;at this critical
moment seemed to have come once more together.
What was the girl doing out here?
Could her appearance really be fortuitous?
The little man's warning became automatically
associated with this unexpected glimpse of her.
Then, with a returning impulse of sanity,
Lavendale brushed his suspicions on one side.
</p>

<p>
'There'll only be farm labourers within sight,
anyway,' he remarked.  'You see, no one could
have known that we were coming here.'
</p>

<p>
'That may be so or it mayn't,' Mr. Hurn
replied dryly.  'Anyway, I guess this is the
boss coming along.'
</p>

<p>
An open touring car, driven by a man in
khaki, drew up at the lodge gate.  General
Bembridge descended briskly and came towards
them, followed by Captain Merrill.
</p>

<p>
'Glad to see you are punctual, Mr. Hurn,'
he said.  'Now, if you please, I am at your
disposal for a quarter of an hour.  What is it
that you have brought to show me?'
</p>

<p>
'That's all right, General,' Mr. Hurn replied
affably.  'You don't need to worry.  I've
been taking my fixings round here.  Just step
this way.'
</p>

<p>
He shambled along across the turf.  The
others followed him, the General walking by
Lavendale's side.
</p>

<p>
'Hasn't your friend brought any apparatus
to show us?' he inquired irritably.  'What's
he going to do?'
</p>

<p>
'Heaven knows, sir!' Lavendale replied.
'He has told me nothing.  If it weren't for
those letters he showed you, I should have
thought he was a lunatic.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn assembled the little party about
twenty-five yards ahead of a fringe of trees
which bordered the road-side and terminated
after a slight break in a compact little spinney.
He turned to Captain Merrill.
</p>

<p>
'Say, young man,' he suggested, 'you just
hop round the other side and make sure there's
no one about.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill, in obedience to a glance from the
General, hurried off.  The latter turned towards
Mr. Hurn.
</p>

<p>
'You are leaving us very much in the dark,
sir, he remarked.  'What is it that you propose
to attempt?'
</p>

<p>
'I propose to accomplish on a small scale,'
Mr. Hurn said grandiloquently, 'a work of
destruction which you can repeat upon any
scale you choose.  See here.'
</p>

<p>
With the utmost solemnity he drew from his
pocket a schoolboy's ordinary catapult and a
pill-box.  From the latter he selected a pellet
a little smaller than a marble.  He fitted it
carefully into the back of the catapult.  Captain
Merrill, who had completed his tour of the
spinney, returned.
</p>

<p>
'There is no one about, sir,' he announced.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hurn had suddenly the air of a man
who attempts great deeds.  His attitude, as
he stepped forward, was almost theatrical.
The General had become very stern and was
obviously annoyed.  Lavendale's heart was
sinking fast.  He was already trying to think
out some form of apology for his share in what
he felt had developed into a ridiculous fiasco.
Nevertheless, their eyes were all riveted upon
the strange little figure a few feet in front of
them.  Slowly he drew back the elastic of the
catapult and discharged the pellet.  It struck
a tree inside the spinney and there was
immediately a curious report, which sounded more
like a slow muttering of human pain than
an ordinary detonation.  Mr. Hurn pointed
towards the spinney.  There were great things
in his attitude and in his gesture.  A queer,
very faint, grey smoke seemed to be stealing
through the place.  There was a sound like
the splitting of branches amongst the trees,
the shrill death cries of terrified animals.  The
General would have moved forward, but
Mr. Hurn caught him by the belt.
</p>

<p>
'Stay where you are, all of you,' he ordered.
'The place ain't safe yet.'
</p>

<p>
The wonder began to grow upon them.  The
various shades of green in the spinney seemed
suddenly, before their eyes, to change into a
universal smoke-coloured ashen-grey.  Without
any cause that they could see, the bark began
to fall away from many of the trees, as though
unseen hands were engaged in some gruesome
task of devastation.  The little party stood
there, spellbound, watching this mysterious
cataclysm.  Mr. Hurn glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
'You can follow me now,' he directed.  'With
this strong westerly wind you won't need
respirators, but breathe as quietly as you can.'
</p>

<p>
They followed him to the edge of the spinney.
There was not one of them who was not
absolutely dumbfounded.  Every shred of colour
had passed from the foliage, the undergrowth
and the hedges.  Flowers and weeds, every
living thing, were the same ashen colour.  The
ground on which their footsteps fell broke away
as though the life had been sapped from it.
There were two rabbits, a dead cock pheasant,
the glory of his plumage turned into a sickly
grey, and a dozen smaller birds, all of the same
ashen shade.  Lavendale kicked one of them.
It crumbled into pieces as though it were the
fossil of some creature a thousand years old.
</p>

<p>
'The pellet which I discharged from the catapult,'
Mr. Hurn announced, in his queer, squeaky
voice, 'contained two grains of my preparation.
Shells can be made to contain a thousand
grains.  I reckon that this spinney is eighty
yards in area.  I will guarantee to you that
within that eighty yards there is not alive, at
the present moment, any bird or insect or
animal of any kind or description.  Just as
they have died, so would have any human being
who had been within this area, have passed
away.  The rest is a matter of the multiplication
table.'
</p>

<p>
'But will your invention bear the shock of
being fired from a gun?' the General asked
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'That is all arranged for,' Mr. Hurn replied.
'I have some trial shells here.  The powder,
which is my invention, is of two sorts, separated
in the shell by a partition.  They are absolutely
harmless until concussion breaks down that
division.  This little matter,' he added, waving
his hand upon that scene of hideous desolation,
'is like the bite of a flea.  A dozen boys with
catapults could destroy a division.  With two
batteries of guns, General, you could destroy
ten miles of trenches and a hundred thousand
men.'
</p>

<p>
They walked around the spinney, still a little
dazed with the wonder of it.  Suddenly Lavendale
gave a little cry.  Out in the field on the
other side lay the motionless body of a woman.
They all hurried towards it.
</p>

<p>
'I thought you came round here, Merrill!'
the General exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'I did, sir,' the young officer replied.  'There
wasn't a soul in sight.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was the first to reach the prostrate
figure.  Almost before he stooped to gaze into
her face, he recognized her.  There were little
flecks of grey upon her dress and she was ghastly
pale.  Her eyes, however, were open, and she
was struggling helplessly to move.
</p>

<p>
'I am all right,' she assured them feebly.
'Has any one&mdash;any brandy?'
</p>

<p>
She tried to sit up, but she was obviously on
the point of collapse.  Mr. Hurn pushed his
way to her side.  From another pill-box which
he had withdrawn from his pocket, he took
out a small pellet and forced it unceremoniously
through her teeth.
</p>

<p>
'I invented an antidote whilst I was about
it,' he explained.  'Had to keep on taking it
myself when I was experimenting.  She's only
got a touch of it.  She'll be all right in five
minutes.  What I should like to know is,' he
concluded suspiciously, 'what the devil she was
doing here, any way.'
</p>

<p>
The recovery of the young lady was almost
magical.  She first sat up.  Then, with the
help of Lavendale's hand, she rose easily to her
feet.  She pointed to the spinney.
</p>

<p>
'What on earth is this awful thing?' she
faltered.
</p>

<p>
No one spoke for a minute.
</p>

<p>
'What were you doing round here, young
lady?' Mr. Hurn asked bluntly.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with her big, innocent eyes
as though surprised.
</p>

<p>
'I was motoring along the road,' she explained,
'when I saw you stop,' she went on, turning
towards the General.  'I remembered that I had
heard there was to be a review here.  I thought
I might see something of it.'
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps,' Merrill suggested, 'the young lady
will give us her name and address?'
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows slightly.
</p>

<p>
'But willingly,' she answered.  'I am Miss
Suzanne de Freyne, and my address is at the
Milan Court.  I haven't done anything wrong,
have I?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing at all,' Lavendale assured her hastily.
'It's we who feel guilty.'
</p>

<p>
'But what does it all mean?' she demanded,
a little pathetically.  'I was just walking across
the field when suddenly that happened.  I felt
as though all the strength were going out of my
body.  I didn't exactly suffocate, but it was
just as though I was swallowing something
which stopped in my throat.'
</p>

<p>
'Capital!' Mr. Hurn exclaimed, his face
beaming.  'Most interesting!  Perhaps, after
all,' he went on complacently, 'if we may
take it for granted that the young lady's
presence is entirely accidental, her
experience is not without some interest to us.'
</p>

<p>
'But will no one tell me what it means?'
she persisted.
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  Lavendale was suddenly
oppressed by a queer foreboding.  The General
took Miss de Freyne courteously by the arm
and led her on one side.  He pointed with
his riding whip to the gate where the limousine
was standing.
</p>

<p>
'Young lady,' he said, 'Captain Merrill here
will take you back to your car.  You will confer
a great obligation upon every one here, and
upon your country, if you allow this little
incident to pass from your mind.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly.  Her eyes seemed to be
seeking for something in Lavendale's face which
she failed to find.  Then she turned away with
a shrug of the shoulders and glanced up at
Captain Merrill.
</p>

<p>
'I am not a prisoner, am I?' she asked.
'Let me assure you all,' she declared, with a
little wave of farewell, 'that I never want to
think of this hateful spot again.'
</p>

<p>
They watched her pass through the gate and
enter the car which was standing in the road.
</p>

<p>
'Does any one know her?' the General
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'She was at the next table to Mr. Hurn here
when I spoke to him at the Milan,' Lavendale
observed thoughtfully.  'She was listening to
our conversation.  It may be a coincidence,
but it seems strange that she should have been
on our heels just at this particular moment.'
</p>

<p>
The General passed his arm through Mr. Hurn's.
</p>

<p>
'The Intelligence Department shall make a
few inquiries,' he promised.  'As for you, my
dear sir, our positions are now reversed.  My
time is yours.  I will find another opportunity
to inspect these troops.  Will you return with
me to the War Office at once?'
</p>

<p>
'Right away,' Mr. Hurn assented.  'And,
General,' he went on, swaggering a little as he
shambled along by the side of the tall, alert,
military figure&mdash;queerest contrast in the
world&mdash;'give me a factory&mdash;one of your ordinary
factories will do, all your ordinary appliances
will do, but give me control of it for one month
and you can invite me to Berlin to the peace
signing.'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
At about half-past eight that evening, after
having waited about for some time in the hall
of the Milan Grill-room, Lavendale handed
his coat and hat to the vestiaire and passed
into the crowded restaurant.  A young man of
excellent poise and balance, he was almost
bewildered at his own sensations as he elbowed
his way through the throng of waiters and
passers-by.  At the corner of the glass screen
he paused.  The girl was there, seated at the
same table, with a newspaper propped up in
front of her.  Her black hair seemed glossier
than ever; her face, unshadowed by any hat,
a little more pallid and forceful.  A fur coat
had fallen back from her white shoulders.
She seemed to be wholly absorbed in the paper
in front of her.
</p>

<p>
'A table, monsieur?' a soft voice murmured
at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shook off his abstraction and
glanced reluctantly away.
</p>

<p>
'I am dining with Mr. Hurn, Jules,' he replied.
'He said eight o'clock, but I can't see anything
of him.'
</p>

<p>
Jules pointed to a table close at hand,
evidently reserved for two people.  There were
<i>hors d'oeuvres</i> waiting and a bottle of wine upon
the ice.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Hurn ordered dinner for eight o'clock
punctually, sir,' he announced.  'I have been
expecting him in for some time.'
</p>

<p>
The girl, as though attracted by their voices,
had raised her eyes.  She looked towards the
unoccupied table by the side of which Jules was
standing.  The three of them for a moment
seemed to have concentrated their regard upon
the same spot, and Lavendale was conscious of
a queer little emotion, an unanalyzable foreboding.
</p>

<p>
'The gentleman ordered a very excellent
dinner,' Jules observed.  'I have already sent
back the cocktails twice.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale glanced at the clock.  Almost at
the same time his eyes met the girl's.  There
was a quiver of recognition in her face.  He
took instant advantage of it and moved towards her.
</p>

<p>
'You are quite recovered, I trust, Miss de Freyne?'
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes to his.  Again he felt
that sense of baffling impenetrability.  It was
impossible even to know whether she appreciated
or resented his question.
</p>

<p>
'I am quite recovered, thank you,' she said.
'You have seen nothing more of our queer
little friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing at all,' she told him.
</p>

<p>
'He invited me to dine with him,' Lavendale
explained, 'at eight o'clock punctually.  I have
been waiting outside for nearly half an hour.'
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the clock and Lavendale,
with a little bow, passed on.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps he meant me to go up to his room,'
he remarked, addressing Jules.  'Do you know
his number?'
</p>

<p>
'Eighty-nine in the Court, sir,' the man
replied.  'Shall I send up?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll go myself,' Lavendale decided.
</p>

<p>
Jules bowed and, although Lavendale did
not glance around, he felt that the girl's eyes
as well as the man's followed him to the door.
He rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth
floor, made his way down the corridor and
paused before number eighty-nine.  He knocked
at the door&mdash;there was no reply.  Then he
tried the handle, which yielded at once to his
touch.  Inside all was darkness.  He turned
on the electric light and pushed open the door
of the sitting-room just in front.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Hurn!' he exclaimed, raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
There was still no reply,&mdash;a strange, brooding
silence which seemed to possess subtle qualities
of mystery and apprehension.  Lavendale had
all the courage and unshaken nerves of youth
and yet at that moment he was afraid.  His
groped along the wall for the switch and
found it with an impulse of relief.  The room
was flooded with soft light&mdash;Lavendale's hand
seemed glued to the little brass knob.  He
stood there with his back to the wall, his face
set, speechless.  Mr. Daniel H. Hurn was seated
in an easy-chair in what appeared at first to
be a natural attitude.  His head, however, had
fallen back, and from his neck drooped the long
end of a silken cord.  Lavendale took one step
forward and then paused again.  The man's
face was visible now&mdash;white, ghastly, with
wide-open, sightless eyes....
</p>

<p>
The valet, who was passing down the corridor,
paused and looked in at the door.
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything wrong, sir?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale seemed to come back with a rush
into the world of real things.  He withdrew
the key from the door, stepped outside and
locked it.
</p>

<p>
'You had better take that to the manager,'
he said.  'I will wait outside here.  Tell him
to come at once.'
</p>

<p>
'Anything wrong, sir?' the valet repeated.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded.
</p>

<p>
'The man there in the chair is dead!' he
whispered.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THE LOST FORMULA
</h3>

<p>
The two young men stood side by side
before the window of the Milan
smoke-room&mdash;Ambrose Lavendale, the American, and
his friend Captain Merrill from the War Office.
Directly opposite to them was a narrow street
running down to the Embankment, at the foot
of which they could catch a glimpse of the
river.  A little to the left was a dark and
melancholy building with a number of sightless
windows.
</p>

<p>
'Wonder what sort of people live in that
place?' Merrill asked curiously.  'Milan
Mansions they call it, don't they?'
</p>

<p>
The other nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Gloomy sort of barracks,' he remarked.
'I've never seen even a face at the window.'
</p>

<p>
'There's a new experience for you, then,'
Merrill observed, pointing a little forward,&mdash;'a
girl's face, too.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was stonily silent, yet when the
momentarily raised curtain had fallen he gave
a little gasp.  It could have been no hallucination.
The face, transfigured though it was, in
a sense, by its air of furtiveness, was, without
a doubt, the face of the girl who had been
constantly in his thoughts for the last three weeks.
He counted the windows carefully from the
ground, noted the exact position of the room
and passed his arm through his friend's.
</p>

<p>
'Come along, Reggie,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'Where to?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't ask any questions,' Lavendale begged.
'Just wait.'
</p>

<p>
They left the hotel by an unfrequented
way, Lavendale half a dozen paces ahead.
Merrill ventured upon a mild protest.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, old chap,' he complained, 'you
might tell me where we are off to?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale slackened his speed for a moment
to explain.
</p>

<p>
'To that room,' he declared.  'Didn't you
recognize the girl's face?'
</p>

<p>
Merrill shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely noticed it.'
</p>

<p>
'It was the girl whom we found unconscious,
half poisoned by that fellow Hurn's diabolical
invention,' Lavendale explained.  'She wasn't
there by accident, either.  I caught her
listening in the Milan Grill-room when Hurn was
talking to me, and the day after the inquest
she disappeared.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill laid a hand upon his friend's arm.
</p>

<p>
'Even if this is so, Lavendale,' he expostulated,
'she probably doesn't want us bothering
over here.  What are you going to say to
her?  Pretty sort of asses we shall look if we
blunder in upon her like this.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale continued to climb the stairs.
By this time they had reached the second
landing.
</p>

<p>
'If you feel that way about it, Merrill,'
he said, 'you can wait for me&mdash;or clear out
altogether, if you like.  I want to have a few
words with this young lady, and I am going
to have them.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill sighed.
</p>

<p>
'I'll see you through it, Ambrose,' he
grumbled.  'All the same, I'm not at all sure that
we are not making fools of ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
They mounted yet another flight.  A crazy
lift went lumbering past them up to the top
of the building.  Lavendale paused outside
a door near the end of the passage.
</p>

<p>
'This should be the one,' he announced.
</p>

<p>
He rang a bell.  They could hear it pealing
inside, but there was no response.  Once more
he pressed the button.  This time it seemed
to them both that its shrill summons was
ringing through empty spaces.  There was no
sound of any movement within.  The door
of the next flat, however, opened.  A tall,
rather stout man, very untidily dressed, with
pale, unwholesome face and a mass of
ill-arranged hair, looked out.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' he said, 'it is no use ringing that
bell.  The only purpose you serve is to disturb
me at my labours.  The flat is empty.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you quite sure about that?' Lavendale
asked.
</p>

<p>
'Absolutely!'
</p>

<p>
'How was it, then, that I saw a face at one
of the windows a quarter of an hour ago?'
Lavendale demanded.
</p>

<p>
'You are mistaken, sir,' was the grim reply.
'The thing is impossible.  The porter who
has the letting of the flat is only on duty in the
afternoon, and, as a special favour to the
proprietors, I have the keys here.'
</p>

<p>
'Then with your permission I will borrow
them,' Lavendale observed.  'I am looking
for rooms in this neighbourhood.'
</p>

<p>
The man bowed and threw open the door.
</p>

<p>
'Come in, sir,' he invited pompously.  'I
will fetch the keys for you.  My secretary,'
he added, with a little wave of his hand,
pointing to a florid, over-buxom and untidy-looking
woman who was struggling with an ancient
typewriter.  'You find me hard at work trying
to finish a play I have been commissioned to
write for my friend Tree.  You are aware,
perhaps, of my&mdash;er&mdash;identity?'
</p>

<p>
'I am sorry,' Lavendale replied.  'You see,
I am an American, not a Londoner.'
</p>

<p>
'That,' the other declared, 'accounts for
it.  My name is Somers-Keyne&mdash;Hamilton
Somers-Keyne.  My work, I trust, is more
familiar to you than my personality?'
</p>

<p>
'Naturally,' Lavendale assented, a little
vaguely.
</p>

<p>
The dramatist, who had been searching
upon a mantelpiece which seemed littered
with cigarette ends, scraps of letters and an
empty tumbler or so, suddenly turned around
with the key in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'It is here,' he pronounced.  'Examine the
rooms for yourself, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'Lavendale.'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Lavendale.  They are furnished, I
believe, but as regards the rent I know nothing
except that the myrmidon who collects it is
unpleasantly persistent in his attentions.  If
you will return the key to me, sir, when you
have finished, I shall be obliged.'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly,' Lavendale promised.
</p>

<p>
The two young men opened the door and
explored a dusty, barely-furnished, gloomy,
conventional little suite, consisting of a single
bedroom, a boxlike sitting-room, and a bathroom
in the last stages of dilapidation.  The
rooms were undoubtedly empty, nor was there
anywhere any sign of recent habitation.
Lavendale stood at the window, leaned over and
counted.  When he drew back his face was
more than ever puzzled.  He looked once
more searchingly around the unprepossessing
rooms.
</p>

<p>
'This was the window, Reggie,' he insisted.
</p>

<p>
Merrill had lost interest in the affair and did
not hesitate to show it.
</p>

<p>
'Seems to me you must have counted
wrongly,' he declared.  'In any case, there's
no one here now, and it's quite certain that
no one has been in during the last hour or so.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale said nothing for a moment.  He
examined the flat once more carefully, locked
it up, and took the key back to Mr. Somers-Keyne's
room.  The dramatist opened the
door himself.
</p>

<p>
'You were favourably impressed, I trust,
with the rooms?' he inquired, holding out
his hand for the key.
</p>

<p>
'I am not sure,' Lavendale replied.  'Tell
me, how long is it since any one occupied them?'
</p>

<p>
'They are dusted and swept once a week,'
Mr. Somers-Keyne told him, looking closely
at his questioner from underneath his puffy
eyelids, 'and they may have been shown
occasionally to a prospective tenant.
Otherwise, no one has been in them for nearly a
month.'
</p>

<p>
'No one could have been in them this morning, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Absolutely impossible,' was the confident
answer.  'The keys have not been off my
shelf.'
</p>

<p>
'We must not interrupt you further,' Lavendale
declared.  'I shall apply for a first night
seat when your production is presented,
Mr. Somers-Keyne.'
</p>

<p>
'You are very good, sir,' the other
acknowledged.  'Your face, I may say, is familiar
to me as a patron of the theatre.  What are
the chances, may I inquire, of your taking up
your residence in this building?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not made up my mind,' Lavendale
replied.  'There are some other particulars
I must have.  I shall call and interview the
hall-porter this afternoon.'
</p>

<p>
'If a welcome, sir, from your nearest
neighbour is any inducement,' Mr. Somers-Keyne
pronounced, 'let me offer it to you.  My
secretary, too, Miss Brown&mdash;I think I
mentioned Miss Brown's name?&mdash;is often nervous
with an empty flat next door.  I am out a great
deal in the evening, Mr. Lavendale.  My work
demands a constant study of the most modern
methods of dramatic production.  You follow
me, I am sure?'
</p>

<p>
'Absolutely,' Lavendale assured him.  'By
the by, sir, we are returning for a moment or
two to the bar at the Milan.  If you will
accompany us&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Somers-Keyne was already reaching out
for his hat.
</p>

<p>
'With the utmost pleasure, my dear young
friends,' he consented.  'The Milan bar was
at one time a hallowed spot to me.  Misfortunes
of various sorts&mdash;but I will not weary you
with a relation of my troubles.  If Tree rings
up, Flora, say that I shall have finished the
second act to-night.  You can tell him that
it is wonderful.  Now, gentlemen!'
</p>

<p>
They left the building together and a few
moments later were ensconced in a corner of the
bar with a bottle of whisky and some tumblers
before them.  Lavendale helped his guest
bountifully.  He had hard work, however, to keep
the trend of the conversation away from the
subject of Mr. Somers-Keyne's early triumphs
upon the stage, which it appeared were
numerous and remarkable.  With every tumblerful
of whisky and soda, indeed, he seemed to grow
more forgetful of his home across the way.
As he expanded he grew more untidy.  His
tie slipped, his collar had flown open, his
waistcoat was spotted with the liquid which had
fallen from the glass in his unsteady efforts to
lift it to his lips.  His pasty face had become
mottled.  Lavendale, who had been watching
his guest closely, fired a sudden question at him.
</p>

<p>
'You don't happen to know a Miss de Freyne,
do you?' he inquired innocently.
</p>

<p>
The change in the man was wonderful.
From a state of maudlin amiability he seemed
to be stricken with an emotion of either fear
or anger.  His eyes narrowed.  He set his
glass down almost steadily, although he was
obliged to breathe heavily several times before
he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne,' he repeated.  'What about her?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale pointed towards the window behind them.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing except that when I was in here
an hour ago I saw Miss de Freyne's face at the
window of that empty suite next to yours,'
he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Somers-Keyne rose to his feet.  A splendid
dignity guided his footsteps and kept his
voice steady.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' he pronounced, 'I am able to surmise
now the reason for your excessive hospitality.
I wish you good morning!'
</p>

<p>
He turned towards the door.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Somers-Keyne,' Lavendale began, rising
hastily to his feet&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The dramatist waved him away.  His gesture,
if a little theatrical, was final.  The honours
remained with him....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lavendale, a few minutes later, on his way
to his luncheon-table in the grill-room, threw
his accustomed glance across the room towards
the corner which was still possessed of a
peculiar interest for him.  He paused in the act
of taking his place.  At her same table, with a
little pile of manuscript propped up in front
of her, Miss de Freyne was seated, studying
the luncheon menu.  For a moment he hesitated.
Then he rose to his feet and, crossing
the room, addressed her.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne!'
</p>

<p>
She glanced up in some surprise.  She seemed,
indeed, scarcely to recognize him.
</p>

<p>
'You have not forgotten me, I hope?' he
continued.  'My name is Lavendale.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' she assented slowly.  'You
were the friend of that strange little creature
with the marvellous invention, weren't you?'
</p>

<p>
'I was scarcely his friend,' Lavendale
corrected, 'but I did my best to help him.'
</p>

<p>
She made a pencil mark in the margin of
the manuscript and laid it face downwards
upon the table.  Then she leaned back in
her chair and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me what happened?' she begged.  'I
was obliged to leave London the next day and
I have only just returned.  Was it suicide
or murder?'
</p>

<p>
'The man was murdered, without a doubt,'
Lavendale replied.
</p>

<p>
'Is that so, really?' she asked gravely.
'Tell me, had he given over his formula to the
War Office?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Unfortunately no!  He was to have handed
it over at eleven o'clock the next morning.'
</p>

<p>
'Was it found amongst his effects?'
</p>

<p>
'Not a written line of any sort.'
</p>

<p>
'Is any one suspected?' she inquired,
dropping her voice a little.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale hesitated and glanced cautiously
around.
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely that,' he answered, 'but you remember
the man Jules, the <i>maîtres d'hôtel</i> here?'
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
'A Swiss, wasn't he?  I was just wondering
what had become of him.
</p>

<p>
'During the investigations the next day,'
Lavendale continued, 'it was discovered that
his papers were forged and that he was in reality
an Austrian.  He was interned at once, of
course, and I believe there was a certain amount
of secrecy about his movements on that night.
So far as I know, though, nothing has been
discovered.'
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
'The detective system over here,' she
remarked, 'is sometimes hopeless, isn't it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yet in one respect,' Lavendale pointed out,
'they certainly were prompt on that night.  I
understand that Jules was interned within
an hour of the discovery of the murder.'
</p>

<p>
Miss de Freyne drew her manuscript towards
her with a little shrug of the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'They failed to find the formula, though,'
she reminded him.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale, accepting his dismissal, returned
to his place, finished his lunch and made his
way round to the Milan Mansions.  A caretaker
was established now in his office in the hall.
He was a small and rather melancholy-looking
man, who hastily concealed a blackened pipe
as Lavendale entered.
</p>

<p>
'I understand that you have a suite to let,'
the latter began, 'upon the third floor?'
</p>

<p>
The man pulled out a list.
</p>

<p>
'We have several suites to let, sir,' he
replied; 'nothing upon the third floor, though.'
</p>

<p>
'What about number thirty-two?'
</p>

<p>
The caretaker shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Number thirty-two is let, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you sure?' Lavendale persisted.  'I
called this morning and was allowed to look
over it by Mr. Somers-Keyne, who had the
keys.'
</p>

<p>
'It was taken by a young lady just before
one o'clock, at our head office,' the man told
him.  'With regard to the other suites, sir&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Could you tell me the young lady's name?'
Lavendale interrupted.
</p>

<p>
'I haven't heard it yet,' the man answered
shortly.  'With regard to the other suites&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale slipped a coin into his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you,' he said, 'there is no other
suite in which I am interested for the moment.'
</p>

<p>
He stepped out.  Almost on the threshold he
met Miss de Freyne, face to face.
</p>

<p>
'Are you coming,' he asked, raising his hat,
'to take possession of your new abode?'
</p>

<p>
She was entirely at her ease.  She looked
at him, however, a little curiously.  It was
as though she were trying to make an
appreciative estimate of him in her mind.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose,' she observed, with a little
sigh, 'that we are playing at cross-purposes.
You are an American, are you not, Mr. Lavendale?'
</p>

<p>
'I am,' he answered.
</p>

<p>
'German-American?'
</p>

<p>
'No!'
</p>

<p>
'English-American?'
</p>

<p>
'No!'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'American.'
</p>

<p>
'Tell me exactly what that means?' she
insisted.
</p>

<p>
'It means that my sympathies are
concentrated upon my own country,' he answered.
'Those prefixes&mdash;German-American or
English-American&mdash;are misnomers.  Wherever my
personal sympathies may be, my patriotism
overshadows them.  Now you know the truth
about me.  I am an American for America.'
</p>

<p>
She sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she murmured, 'I had an idea that
was your point of view.  I am a Frenchwoman,
you see, for France.'
</p>

<p>
'Our interests,' he remarked, 'should not
be far apart.'
</p>

<p>
'If I were sure of that,' she declared, 'the
rest would be easy.  I am for France and for
France only.  You are for America, and, I
am afraid, for America only.'
</p>

<p>
'Chance, in this instance,' he ventured,
'has at any rate made us allies.'
</p>

<p>
'I should like to feel quite sure about that,'
she said.  'If you are not busy, will you walk
with me on to the Embankment?'
</p>

<p>
They strolled down the narrow street and
found a seat in the gardens.
</p>

<p>
'Between thieves,' she continued, looking
him in the face, 'there is sometimes honour.
Why not amongst those who are engaged
upon affairs which, if not nefarious, are at least
secret?  Let us see whether we can be allies,
and, if not, where our interests clash.  You
know perfectly well, as I do, that Jules
murdered that little chemist from Chicago and
stole the formula.  You know very well that
the suite in which you take so much interest
in the Milan Mansions, belongs to Jules.  You
know very well that he was arrested there a
quarter of an hour after he left the hotel, and
that he had had no time to dispose of the
formula.  You know that the place has been
searched, inch by inch, but that the formula
has not been found.'
</p>

<p>
'I have just arrived exactly as far as that
myself,' Lavendale assented mendaciously.
</p>

<p>
'You are some time behind me, but it is
true that we have arrived at the same point,'
she continued.  'Now the question is, can we
work together?  What should you do with
the formula if ever it came into your possession?'
</p>

<p>
His lips tightened.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot tell you that,' he said firmly.
</p>

<p>
'I believe that I know,' she went on.  'Well,
let me put you to the test.'
</p>

<p>
She opened a black silk bag which she was
carrying, a little trifle with white velvet lining
and turquoise clasp.  From a very dainty
pocket-book in the interior she drew out a
crumpled sheet of paper, covered with strange,
cabalistic signs.  She smoothed it out upon her
knee and handed it to him.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' she exclaimed, 'there it is!  Now you
shall tell me what you are going to do with it?'
</p>

<p>
His hand had closed over the piece of paper.
He gripped it firmly.  Before she could stop
him he had transferred it to his own pocket.
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'You had better return it to me,' she advised.
</p>

<p>
'I shall not,' he replied.  'Forgive me.  I
did not ask you for the formula&mdash;I did not
know you had discovered it&mdash;but since I have
it, I want you to remember that it was the
discovery of an American and I shall keep it
for my country.'
</p>

<p>
'But your country is not in need of anything
of the sort,' she protested.
</p>

<p>
'I will be so far frank with you as to explain
my motive,' he said.  'A few months ago I
was attached to the American Embassy here.
I have been attached to the Embassy in Paris,
and for two months I was in Berlin.  I have
come to certain conclusions about America,
in which I differ entirely from the popular
opinion and the popular politics of my country.
England has been living for many years in
great peril, but there have been many who
have recognized that.  The peril of America
is at least as great, and has remained almost
altogether unrecognized.  We have no army,
a small navy, an immense seaboard, wealth
sufficient to excite the cupidity of any nation.
And we have no allies.  We make the grave
and serious mistake of ignoring world politics,
of believing ourselves outside them and yet
imagining ourselves capable of protecting the
interests of American citizens in foreign
countries.  That is where I know we are wrong.
I have resigned from the Diplomatic Service
of America but I remain her one secret agent.
I intend to keep this formula for her.  She
will need it.'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne de Freyne shook her head.
</p>

<p>
You will not be able to leave the gardens
alive with it,' she assured him.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at her incredulously.  Her smooth
face was unwrinkled.  She had the air of
looking at him as though he were a child.
</p>

<p>
'You are in the kindergarten stage of your
profession,' she observed.  'Now watch.  You
see those two men seated on the bench a little
way further down?'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
She rose from her seat, shook out her skirt
and sat down again.  The two men, also, had
risen and were advancing towards them.  She
held up her hand&mdash;they seemed somehow to
drift away.
</p>

<p>
'I repeat,' she went on, 'that you would not
leave this garden alive.  But, my friend, we
will not quarrel over a worthless scrap of paper,
for that is precisely what you have carefully
buttoned up in your pocket-book.  I have
failed to find the formula.  That is a dummy.
Keep it, if you will.  There isn't a single
intelligible sign upon it.'
</p>

<p>
He drew it from his pocket and glanced at
it.  Even with his slight knowledge of chemistry
he was compelled to admit that her words were
truth.
</p>

<p>
'Keep it or give it me back, as you like,'
she continued.  'It has no value.  The fact
remains that in his brief journey from the
service room at the Milan Grill-room to his
rooms in the Milan Mansions, Jules managed
to conceal somewhere or other the paper which
he has taken from Hurn.  If he passed it on
to some one else, it is by this time in Germany,
but we have reason to know that he did not.
The paper is still in concealment.  It is still
to be found.'
</p>

<p>
'And the means?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders lightly.
</p>

<p>
'Alas!' she exclaimed, 'how can I tell you
now?  How can I even engage your help?
You have disclosed your hand.'
</p>

<p>
He sat gazing gloomily out at the river.
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' he decided at last, 'let me help
and I will be content with a copy of the formula.'
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
'That is rather sensible of you,' she said.
'To tell you the truth, I require your help.
For reasons which I need not explain, we do
not wish this matter to be dealt with in any
way officially.  I am in perfect accord with
the English Secret Service, but we do not wish
to have their men seen about the Milan
Mansions.  To-night, Jules re-enters into
possession of his rooms.  I offer you an adventure.
It is what you wish?'
</p>

<p>
'But I thought Jules was interned?'
</p>

<p>
'He was and is,' she told him, 'but the
greater powers are working.  This afternoon
he will be permitted to escape&mdash;he thinks
through the agency of friends.  He will come
to London in a motor-car, he will come at
once to his rooms, and, although every inch
of them has been searched, I am perfectly
convinced that somewhere in them or between
them and the Milan, he will lay his hands upon
the formula.  You care about this adventure?'
</p>

<p>
His eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
'Care about it!' he repeated enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
She smiled and rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
'Leave me now,' she begged.  'I want to
speak to one of those men for a minute.  You can
dine with me in the Grill-room at the Milan at
seven o'clock, in morning clothes.  Till then,
<i>au revoir!</i>'
</p>

*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
The spirit of adventure warmed Lavendale's
blood that night.  He ordered his dinner with
unusual care, and he was delighted to find his
guest sufficiently human to appreciate the
delicacies he had chosen and the vintage of
the champagne which he had selected.  Their
conversation was entirely general, almost
formal.  They had both lived for some time
in Paris and found mutual acquaintances there.
As they neared the conclusion of the meal she
was summoned to the telephone.  She was
absent only for a short time but when she
returned she began to collect her few trifles.
</p>

<p>
'The car passed through Slough,' she said,
'a quarter of an hour ago.  I think perhaps
we had better be moving.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale signed his bill and they left the
hotel together.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing else you think you ought to tell
me, I suppose?' he remarked, as they crossed
the narrow street.  'I am rather in the dark,
you know.  The idea is, isn't it, that Jules is
coming up to get the formula from some hiding-place
in his room?  Where shall we be?'
</p>

<p>
'Wait,' she begged.
</p>

<p>
They climbed the stairs in silence&mdash;the girl
had purposely avoided the lift.  Arrived on
the third floor, she passed the door of number
thirty-two and knocked softly at the adjoining
one.  There was, for a moment, no answer.
At the second summons, however, the door
was cautiously opened.  The untidy secretary
admitted them.  In her soiled black dress,
shapeless and crumpled, with her fat, peevish
face and dishevelled peroxidized hair, she was
by no means an attractive object.  She pointed
half indignantly to where Mr. Somers-Keyne
was lying upon the couch, gazing towards
them in incapable silence with a fatuous smile
upon his lips.
</p>

<p>
'If it's from you he gets the money for this
sort of thing,' she said sharply, 'why, I wish
you'd keep it, and that's straight.  How are
we to get on with our work or anything, with
him in that condition?'
</p>

<p>
'Scondition'sh all right,' Mr. Somers-Keyne
insisted, making a weak effort to rise.
</p>

<p>
Miss de Freyne frowned for a moment as
she appreciated the situation.  Then she waved
him back.
</p>

<p>
'Don't try to get up, Mr. Somers-Keyne,
she begged.  'We can manage without you.
Lie down and rest for a little time.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Somers-Keyne sank back with a sigh of
content.
</p>

<p>
'Very shorry,' he murmured.  'Tree'sh
awfully annoyed with me.  Promished go down
and shee him sh'evening.'
</p>

<p>
'Is this fellow one of your helpers?'
Lavendale asked.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
'In a small way.  Never mind, we don't
need him to-night.  Come here.'
</p>

<p>
She led him to the side of the wall nearest
the adjoining apartment.  Her fingers felt about
the pattern of the paper.  Presently she found
a crack, pushed for a moment and a sliding
door rolled back.  She stretched out her hand
through the darkness and turned a small
knob.  A wardrobe door swung outwards.
They looked into the shadowy obscurity of
the adjoining room.  Lavendale whistled softly.
</p>

<p>
'This is all very well,' he said, 'but how
can we watch Jules whilst the door is closed?'
</p>

<p>
She pointed to two or three little ventilation
holes near the top of the wardrobe.  Lavendale
applied his eye to one of them and nodded.
</p>

<p>
'That's all right,' he admitted.  'There's
just enough light.  Listen!'
</p>

<p>
They could both of them hear the quick,
eager footsteps of a man lightly shod, stealthy,
ascending the last flight of stairs.  Her fingers
gripped his arm for a moment.  An excitement
more poignant than any begotten by their
hazardous adventure suddenly thrilled him.
The greatest adventure of all was at hand....
</p>

<p>
The footsteps paused, the door slowly opened.
It was Jules who entered.  He stood looking
around for a moment, then unexpectedly
fingered the switch which stood upon the wall.
The apartment was flooded with light.  Jules
stood in the centre of it, distinctly visible.
He was paler even than usual, and his eyes
were a little sunken, but he had lost, somehow
or other, that bearing of graceful servility
which had distinguished him in his former
avocation.  An expression of subdued
cunning had taken its place.  He looked around
the apartment searchingly.  His eyes rested
for a moment upon a small print at the further
end of the room, which was hanging upon the
wall in a crooked position.  As his eyes fell
upon it, he frowned.  He seemed suddenly
to stiffen into a new attention.  He glanced
once more around him as though in fear and
picked up his overcoat from the bed.  Before
they could realize what his intentions were,
he had left the room, closing the door behind him.
</p>

<p>
'What does that mean?' Lavendale whispered.
</p>

<p>
She pushed open the wardrobe door.  A little
breath of fresher air was grateful to both of
them.  Then she turned and pointed towards
the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>
'It was that print,' she murmured.  'It
must have been a signal to him that he was
being watched.  You see, it is on one side.
I am perfectly certain that when I was here
this morning it was straight.'
</p>

<p>
'A signal from whom?'
</p>

<p>
She had no time to answer him.  They could
hear the door of the next room open.  Their
eyes met.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Somers-Keyne!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
They stepped back into the wardrobe.  Her
fingers felt for the spring.  Suddenly they both
heard, within a few inches of them, on the other
side of the wall, the sound of a click.  She
pressed the spring in vain.  Then she stepped
back and turned on the electric light in the
room.
</p>

<p>
'Try the door,' she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale tried it.  As they both expected,
it was locked.  She drew a master-key from
her pocket and opened it swiftly.  They were
out in the corridor now, empty and silent.
They could not even hear the sound of any one
moving about in Mr. Somers-Keyne's room.
Lavendale stood before the latter's door and
listened.  There was a mumbling as though
of smothered voices, then suddenly an angry
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
'Sick of the lot of you, that's what I am!
Here's the old man dictates his rubbish for
about an hour a day and talks drivelling,
drunken piffle for the rest of it!  Where's
my salary coming from, that's what I want
to know?'
</p>

<p>
They heard Jules apparently trying to soothe
her.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Miss Brown, in a few days, if you
will only be patient&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Patient!  Who's going to be patient with
that old drunkard blithering around all the
time?  I've had enough!'
</p>

<p>
They heard the sound of stamping footsteps
and Mr. Somers-Keyne's sonorous voice.
</p>

<p>
'Flora, my dear, mosht unreasonable, I'm
sure.  Shimply asked you go out for a few
minutes while Mr. Jules and I dishcuss
important matter.'
</p>

<p>
'And I'm going out for a minute,' Miss
Brown shouted, suddenly opening the door,
'and you may thank your stars when you see
me again!'
</p>

<p>
She appeared upon the threshold, holding
a slatternly hat upon her head with one hand
and sticking hatpins in with the other.  She
stared insolently at Lavendale and his
companion, and brushed her way past them.
</p>

<p>
'Here's visitors for you,' she called out over
her shoulder.  'You'll have to get rid of them
now before you start on your precious business.'
</p>

<p>
She flopped down the stairs.  The newcomers
stepped across the threshold.  Jules stared
at them in surprise.  Mr. Somers-Keyne nodded
his head ponderously.  His mind seemed to be
still running upon Miss Brown's departure.
</p>

<p>
'A mosht ungrateful young woman,' he
declared.  'Mish&mdash;er&mdash;de Freyne, your shervant.
Thish gentleman is the tenant of the
roomsh you looked over other day.  Mr. Lavendale,
don't like you.  Don't want you here.
Ashked me questions about you, Mish de Freyne.
Not a nice young man at all.  You lishen to
me a moment.'
</p>

<p>
He staggered to his feet.  Jules stood in
the background.  There was something of the
old obsequiousness about his manner.
Mr. Somers-Keyne swayed for a moment upon his
feet.  Then Lavendale felt a sudden
inspiration.  He turned on his heel.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me for one moment,' he whispered
to the girl by his side.
</p>

<p>
He turned away with no show of haste, though
the eyes of both men seemed to follow him.
Then he ran down the stairs on tiptoe, taking
them three at a time as he neared the ground
floor.  The motor-car was drawn up outside,
there was no sign of any one else in the street.
He sprang to the other side of the way and
saw at once the object of his pursuit, hurrying
down towards the Embankment.  He followed
her as stealthily as possible.  Without looking
around she increased her own pace, crossed
the Embankment and leaned for a moment
over the wall.  A few yards further on were
the steps and a little pier, and close by a small
tug was waiting.  Lavendale, who was within
reach of her now, stretched out his hand and
seized her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'I want you, Miss Brown!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
She turned and confronted him, her face
mottled and flushed with the unusual exercise,
a strand of her unwholesome-looking hair
hanging down to her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Now what's wrong with you?' she shouted.
'Can't you leave me alone?  I'm not coming
back.'
</p>

<p>
'Where are you going?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'That's none of your business,' she snapped.
'Let me pass.'
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the tug and his hand closed
upon her wrist.  He was a strong man, but
she almost succeeded in wrenching herself
free.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Miss Brown,' he said, 'the
game's up.  I want that paper you're keeping
for Jules.'
</p>

<p>
She suddenly showed her teeth.  Her face
was like the face of a wild animal.  She
struggled so violently that they swayed towards
the parapet.  Her left hand slipped into the
bosom of her gown.  Before he could stop her,
her fingers were making pulp of the paper
which she had drawn up in crushed fragments.
She threw it over the parapet into the black
water.  Then she ceased to struggle.  She
laughed hysterically and leaned back against
the wall.  The water near where the fragments
of paper had fallen was all churned up&mdash;the
little tug had hurried off.
</p>

<p>
'Clever, ain't you?' she mocked.  'Any
need to hold on to me any more?'
</p>

<p>
He released her wrist.  The car had come
thundering down the little street.  It
suddenly pulled up with a grinding of brakes.
Suzanne sprang lightly out.
</p>

<p>
'The formula?' she cried.
</p>

<p>
He pointed downwards to the water.
</p>

<p>
'Destroyed!'
</p>

<p>
Her sigh was almost one of relief.
</p>

<p>
'Was there a tug here?' she asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
'It made off when they saw us struggling.'
</p>

<p>
'He told the truth, then!' she exclaimed.
'Jules shot himself as soon as he realized
that the game was up&mdash;there in the room before
me, a few minutes ago.  He told me with his
last breath that the formula was on its way
down the river to Germany.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
'It's on its way down the river, right enough,'
he assented, 'but I don't think it will reach
Germany.'

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
A DEAL WITH NIKO
</h3>

<p>
Lavendale paused in the act of struggling
with his tie, and looked steadfastly
into the mirror in front of him.  He had heard
no definite sound, yet some queer intuition
seemed to have suddenly awakened within
his subconscious mind a sense of the
mysterious, something close at hand, unaccountable,
minatory.  His flat was empty and the catch
of the front door secure, yet he knew very well
that he was being watched.  He turned slowly
around.
</p>

<p>
'What the mischief&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He broke off in his sentence.  A small
man, dressed in black clothes, imperturbable,
yellow-skinned, and with Oriental type of
features, was standing to attention, a clothes-brush
in his hand.  His dark, oval eyes rested
for a moment upon the crumpled failure of
Lavendale's tie.  Without a word he took
another from an open drawer, came softly
across the room and reached upwards.  Before
Lavendale knew what was happening, the bow
which had been worrying him for the last five
minutes was faultlessly tied.  He glanced into
the mirror and was compelled to give vent to
a little exclamation of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
'That's all very well, you know,' he said,
turning once more around.  'The tie's all
right, but who the devil are you, and what are
you doing in my rooms?'
</p>

<p>
The man bowed.  Again the Oriental seemed
to assert itself in the subtle ease with which
he almost prostrated himself.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' he explained, 'I am the friend of
your servant Perkins.'
</p>

<p>
'Then perhaps you can tell me where on earth
Perkins is?' Lavendale demanded.
</p>

<p>
'He is in the hospital, sir,' the man answered.
'He met with a slight accident while he and
I were together.  I am his messenger.  I
undertook to bring you news of him and to do what
I could, in my poor way, to fill his place for
this evening.  He lent me his key.  It was in
that manner I was able to gain entrance here.'
</p>

<p>
'An accident?' Lavendale repeated.  'What
sort of an accident?'
</p>

<p>
'I chose an idle word, perhaps,' the other
confessed.  'It was indeed more a matter
of sudden illness.  Perkins and I lunched
together at the Chinese Restaurant in Piccadilly
Circus.  As we left the place, he faltered; he
fainted in the passage.  I called a taxicab
and took him to the hospital.  It was not a
great affair, they said, but it was better that
he should rest there.  So I came to you.'
</p>

<p>
'And who the dickens may you be?'
</p>

<p>
'My name is Niko.  I came from Japan
with General Kinish, military attaché to the
Japanese Embassy.  He has gone to the Italian
Front and left me without a situation.'
</p>

<p>
'You're all right at ties, any way,' Lavendale
admitted, glancing once more into the mirror.
'All the same, I think I can get along without
a man until Perkins comes back.'
</p>

<p>
His hands sought his trousers pockets but
Niko shook his head gravely.
</p>

<p>
'It is impossible,' he protested.  'Perkins
may be away for a week.  I shall wait upon
you until he returns.  It is best.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, have it your own way,' Lavendale
remarked.  'Better answer that bell, then.
If it is a lady, show her into the sitting-room.'
</p>

<p>
Niko glided away and returned in a moment.
</p>

<p>
'The lady,' he announced, 'is in the sitting-room.'
</p>

<p>
He held up Lavendale's coat and the latter
hastened from the room.  Suzanne de Freyne
was standing facing the door as he entered, her
theatre cloak thrown back.  He took her hands.
</p>

<p>
'You are adorably punctual!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me,' she asked, a little abruptly, 'how
long have you had your valet?'
</p>

<p>
'About five minutes, I believe,' he answered.
'He is a substitute.  My own man was taken
ill at luncheon-time.  Why do you ask?'
</p>

<p>
'Because he is the first person,' she explained,
'who has succeeded in puzzling me in one
particular way since I can remember.'
</p>

<p>
He looked at her as though for an explanation,
and in a moment she continued.
</p>

<p>
'I flatter myself that I never forget a face.
Your valet is perfectly well-known to me and
yet I cannot tell you who he is.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale glanced uneasily towards the door.
</p>

<p>
'I shan't keep him,' he said.  'I hate
prejudices, but I am full of them.  The fellow's
a Jap, of course.'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne did not reply for a moment.  Her
attention seemed to have suddenly wandered.
Then she turned around with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
'I am hungry, my friend!' she exclaimed.
'Let us go.  And yet, remember this.
Temporary servants are bad things for people who
follow our profession.'
</p>

<p>
They left the room.  Niko was standing
with the front door wide open, his master's hat
and gloves in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'I will be here at seven o'clock in the
morning, sir,' he promised, 'and bring news of
Perkins.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded.  The door was closed
softly behind them.  At the bottom of the
stairs he glanced up.
</p>

<p>
'Wish I could get rid of the ridiculous idea
I have about that fellow,' he remarked.
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything in your rooms of particular&mdash;I
will not say value, I will say interest?'
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose I have the usual amount of
valuables,' he admitted, 'but Perkins is a very
careful servant, and I am sure he would never
have sent any one who wasn't reliable.  As
regards my papers and that sort of thing, they
are all locked up in a safe with a combination
lock.'
</p>

<p>
She did not pursue the subject and it faded
quickly from Lavendale's mind.  They dined
in a quiet corner at the Milan and they talked
of many things, chiefly the war.
</p>

<p>
'Do you realize,' he asked her, towards the
end of their meal, 'that you are still a
complete mystery to me?'
</p>

<p>
She nodded affably.
</p>

<p>
'Yes?'
</p>

<p>
'You know what I mean, of course,' he went
on.  'Three weeks ago we joined hands for a
moment.  We were&mdash;may I not use the
word?&mdash;associates.  We were not, perhaps, completely
successful in our enterprise, but at least we
prevented that marvellous secret from ever
reaching an enemy's hands.  Then you
disappeared.  I heard nothing from you until your
voice startled me down the telephone to-night&mdash;you
want to dine with me.  Well, I am your
slave and here I am, but tell me, where have
you been all this time?'
</p>

<p>
'In France,' she answered.
</p>

<p>
'And what have you been doing?'
</p>

<p>
'Attending to my own business.'
</p>

<p>
'And what is that?' he asked coolly.
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows but her air of offence
was obviously assumed.  She lit a cigarette
and watched the smoke for a minute.  He was
absorbed in the study of her hands&mdash;her
unusually firm yet delicate fingers, ringless save
for one large, quaintly-cut emerald.
</p>

<p>
'In my life,' she said, 'I have no confidants.'
</p>

<p>
'That seems a pity,' he replied.  'We might
be useful to one another.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not so sure,' she answered thoughtfully.
'For instance, although we speak together in
English, my soul is French.  I am for France
and France only.  England is our very dear
ally.  England is a splendid and an honourable
nation, but it is France's future welfare in which
I am concerned, and not England's.  You,
on the other hand, are Saxon.  England and
America, after all, are very close together.'
</p>

<p>
'Greatest mistake of your life,' he assured
her.  'I have a great respect for England and
a great liking for English people, and I believe
that she was dragged into this war without
wanting it, but, on the other hand, as I told
you once before, I am for America and America
only.  England has asked for what she is
getting for a good many years.  If even she
gets a good hiding it won't do her any harm.'
</p>

<p>
'But America is so far outside,' she observed.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you make any mistake,' he answered
promptly.  'The world grows smaller, year
by year.  The America of fifty years ago has
become impossible to-day.  We have our
political interests in every country, and, however
slow and unwilling we may be to take up our
responsibilities, we've got to come into line
with the other great Powers and use the same
methods.'
</p>

<p>
'You may be right,' she confessed.  'Very
well, then, you are for America and I am for
France.  Now tell me, as between Germany
and England how are your sympathies?'
</p>

<p>
'With England, without a doubt,' he
pronounced.  'Mind, I am not a rabid anti-German.
I am not in the least sure that a nation
with the great genius for progress that Germany
has shown is not to some extent justified by
taking up the sword to hew a larger place in the
world for her own people.  But that does not
affect my answer to your question.  My
sympathies are with England.'
</p>

<p>
She flicked the ash from her cigarette.  She
was looking a little languidly across the room
towards a table set against the wall.
</p>

<p>
'If your sympathy were a little stronger,'
she remarked quietly, 'I could show you how
to render England an incalculable service.'
</p>

<p>
'Tell me how?'
</p>

<p>
'First of all,' she continued, 'look at those
three men and tell me what you think of them?'
</p>

<p>
He turned a little in his place and glanced
towards the table which she had indicated.
One of the three men who were seated at it
was obviously a foreigner.  His hair was grey
towards the temples, although his moustache
was almost jet-black; his cheek-bones were
high, his teeth a little prominent.  He wore
evening clothes of the most correct cut, his
shirt and links were unexceptionable.  His
two companions were men of a different stamp.
The one who seemed to dominate the party
was a huge man, clean-shaven, with puffy
face and small eyes.  He wore a dark flannel
suit of transatlantic cut.  He was drinking a
large whisky and soda and smoking a cigar,
and had apparently eaten nothing.  His
companion was of smaller build, with flaxen
moustache and hair, and dressed in light grey clothes
and yellow boots.  On the face of it, the trio
were ill-assorted.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I should say,' Lavendale remarked,
'that the dark man in the corner chair was a
foreigner&mdash;a Russian, for choice.  The other
two are, of course, American business men.
The face of the big man seems familiar to me.'
</p>

<p>
'You've probably seen his picture in the
illustrated papers,' she told him.  'That is
Jacob P. Weald.  He was once called, I believe,
the powder king.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded.  His manner had become
more interested.
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' he murmured.  'And that's
Jenkins, the secretary to the Weald Company.
I wonder who the third man is?'
</p>

<p>
'His name is Ossendorf&mdash;the Baron Cyril
Ossendorf.  He is a <i>persona grata</i> at the Russian
Embassy and he owns great estates in Poland.'
</p>

<p>
'Stop!' Lavendale exclaimed.  'This is getting
interesting.  He is buying munitions, of
course.'
</p>

<p>
'Marvellous!' she murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Don't chaff me&mdash;it's really interesting.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she admitted, 'it is interesting even
from its external point of view.  You are
right.  The Baron is probably giving, or has
given, an enormous order for ammunition.
Yet there is something behind that little
conference, if only we could probe it, more
interesting than you would believe, my
friend.'
</p>

<p>
She paused.  He waited eagerly, but she was
silent for an unusually long time.
</p>

<p>
'You were suggesting,' he ventured to remind
her, 'a few minutes ago, that there was
some way in which intervention&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She leaned a little towards him.  Her hand
rested for a second upon his.
</p>

<p>
'I have come to the conclusion,' she said,
speaking very softly, 'that one of us, either
you or I, must kill Ossendorf.'
</p>

<p>
He began to laugh and then stopped suddenly.
A little shiver ran through him.  For a single
second her face was almost the face of a tigress.
He felt that his laugh was a mistake.
</p>

<p>
'You are in earnest!' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
She rose from the table, gathered up her
belongings and allowed him to arrange her
cloak about her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Except that I retract that possible alternative,'
she said calmly.  'I shall deal with
Ossendorf myself.'
</p>

<p>
'But I don't understand,' he persisted.
</p>

<p>
'How should you?' she answered, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'By the by, where are we going?  We spoke
of a music hall, didn't we?'
</p>

<p>
'I have a box at the Empire,' he told her.
</p>

<p>
She was stepping by him into the taxi when
she suddenly paused.  Her frame seemed to
become rigid.
</p>

<p>
'The Empire,' he told the driver.
</p>

<p>
She turned suddenly around.
</p>

<p>
'Your rooms,' she directed.  'Tell him to
drive at once to your rooms.'
</p>

<p>
He was startled, but he obeyed her without
hesitation.  A moment later he took his place
by her side.
</p>

<p>
'That valet of yours!' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'What about him?'
</p>

<p>
'I told you that I knew his face.  I have
just remembered.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'A year ago he was an attaché at the Japanese
Embassy.  His name is Baron Komashi.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was mystified.
</p>

<p>
'Are you sure?' he asked incredulously.
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly certain,' she insisted.
</p>

<p>
'But why on earth should he be a friend
of Perkins and willing to act as my valet?'
</p>

<p>
'It's the eternal game,' she declared, 'and
they are clever at it, too, the Japs.  Tell me,
have you any papers of special value about
just now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, in my safe,' he admitted, 'but no
one else has an idea of the combination.'
</p>

<p>
'Combination!' she scoffed.  'Niko
Komashi, too!  Tell me, are these papers
political which you have inside that safe?'
</p>

<p>
'In a measure, yes!' he assented.
</p>

<p>
They had reached the street in which his
rooms were situated.
</p>

<p>
'There is no light in my room,' he said, as
they ascended the stairs.  'Niko must have
done his work and gone home.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she murmured, 'he has done his work,
without a doubt.  He has a knack of doing that.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale produced his latch-key.  The
rooms appeared to be empty and in darkness.
In the sitting-room he unlocked his safe and
peered in.  One by one he examined his papers.
Everything was in perfect order.  He turned
back to his companion.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing has been disturbed,' he announced
confidently.
</p>

<p>
She came over towards him, put her head
for a moment inside the safe and immediately
withdrew it.
</p>

<p>
'Niko has been through these papers during
your absence,' she declared.  'If everything
is there, it is because he had no need to steal.
He has examined or made copies of what he
chose.'
</p>

<p>
'How do you know this?' he asked incredulously.
</p>

<p>
'It is quite simple,' she explained.  Even
the cleverest man in the world seems always
to forget one thing.  Niko forgot that his
clothes and fingers, even his breath, have
always that peculiar Oriental perfume.  What
is it like&mdash;half almond-blossom, half sandalwood?'
</p>

<p>
'I remember I noticed it when he came in,'
Lavendale agreed quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Put your head inside that safe again,' she
directed.
</p>

<p>
He obeyed at once.  When he emerged, his
face was troubled.  He locked the door mechanically.
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' he said.
</p>

<p>
They were silent for a moment.  Lavendale
was contemplating the lock in a dazed manner.
He turned to Suzanne.  She had seated herself
in his easy-chair and had thrown back her
cloak.
</p>

<p>
'You were going to tell me,' he reminded
her, 'about this fellow Niko.  You had an
idea about him.'
</p>

<p>
'Mine is no idea,' she replied.  'It is a
certainty.  The man who posed this evening as
your temporary valet, the man who in your
absence has opened your safe, why, it is Baron
Niko Komashi.  He belongs to one of the most
aristocratic families of Japan.'
</p>

<p>
'But he is a member of the Servants' Club!'
Lavendale expostulated.  'He was a friend of
Perkins&mdash;my servant!'
</p>

<p>
'Ostensibly,' she said dryly.  'He came over
here as first secretary to the Embassy.  Then
he disappeared.  No one quite knew what
had become of him.  I once had a suspicion.
Now I know.  You and I, my friend, are
bunglers at the game he plays.'
</p>

<p>
Once more Lavendale was looking at the
lock&mdash;unscratched, bearing so signs of having
been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
'The thing is a miracle,' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me&mdash;unless you would rather not,'
she asked, leaning a little forward, 'was there
any document in that safe likely to be of
particular interest to the Japanese Secret Service?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale's face was dark with mingled shame
and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
'There was just the one document that should
have been kept from them at all costs,' he
declared bitterly.  'Two years ago I wrote a
series of articles for an American Sunday paper
upon our military unpreparedness.  I don't
know that they did any particular good, but,
anyway, it's a subject I have studied closely.
That paper I had my fingers on just now
contains every possible scrap of information as to
our standing army, our volunteer forces, our
artillery, our possible scheme of defence on
the west and the east, our stock of munitions,
and our expenditure of same per thousand
men.  There was also an air and naval report
and a scheme for mining San Francisco Harbour.'
</p>

<p>
She leaned back in her chair and laughed.
</p>

<p>
'Most interesting!  I can quite understand
how Niko's eyes would gleam! ... What's that?'
</p>

<p>
She turned her head suddenly.  Lavendale,
too, had started, and with a swift movement
forward had touched the switch and plunged
the room into darkness.  They heard the soft
click of the latch and the opening and closing
of the front door.  They heard the soft
footsteps of the intruder across the hall.  The
door of the room in which they were was quietly
opened and closed.  Still with that same amazing
stealthiness, a small, dark figure crossed the
room and stood before the safe.  Then there
was a pause, several breathless moments of
silence.  Niko's instinct was telling him that
he was not alone.  Once more Lavendale's
finger touched the switch and the lights blazed
out.  Niko was standing, the knob of the safe
in his hand, his head turned towards them.
</p>

<p>
The sudden light had a common effect upon
all of them.  Suzanne for a moment held her
hand in front of her eyes.  Niko blinked
slightly.  Then he drew himself up to his full
height of five feet four.  He stood in front
of the safe with his eyes fixed upon Lavendale,
something about his face and attitude bearing
a curious resemblance to a statue carved in
wax.  Lavendale coughed.
</p>

<p>
'You remind me, Baron Komashi,' he said,
'of an old English proverb&mdash;the pitcher that goes
once too often to the well, you know.  Was it
something you had forgotten that brought
you back?  No, stay where you are, please.'
</p>

<p>
Niko remained motionless.  Lavendale moved
to a long, open cupboard which stood
against the wall, opened it and groped about
amongst its contents for a moment.  Then he
swung the door to and slipped some cartridges
into the little revolver which he had taken from
the top shelf.  Niko's muscles suddenly seemed
to relax.  Ever so slightly he shrugged his
shoulders.  It was the gesture of a supreme
philosophy.
</p>

<p>
'There's no need for a row,' Lavendale went
on.  'The game you and I are playing at,
Baron Komashi, requires finesse rather than
muscle.  By a stroke of genius you have read
a certain document in that safe.  That document
is naturally of interest to the representative
of the one country with whom America
might possibly quarrel.'
</p>

<p>
Niko bowed his sleek head.
</p>

<p>
'I have read the document,' he confessed.
'It was my business here to read it.  And now?'
</p>

<p>
'There you have me,' Lavendale admitted.
'It is a document, without a doubt, of great
interest to you, and your Government will
highly appreciate a résumé of its contents.
At the same time, the only way to stop your
making use of your information is to kill you.'
</p>

<p>
The man's face was like the face of a sphinx.
Suzanne leaned a little further back in her
chair and crossed her legs.
</p>

<p>
'It is a fortunate century in which you pursue
your career, Baron,' she observed, 'and perhaps
a fortunate country.  These little qualms about
human life which I can clearly see are
influencing Mr. Lavendale, scarcely exist, even
now, amongst your people, do they?'
</p>

<p>
'We are as yet,' Niko replied suavely, 'free,
I am thankful to say, from the cowardice of
the west.'
</p>

<p>
'If I asked you for your word of honour,'
Lavendale continued, 'that you would not use
that information?
</p>

<p>
'I might give it you,' Niko acknowledged,
'but my country's service is a higher thing
than my personal honour, therefore it would
do you no good.  I shall be frank with you.
There is no way you can prevent my report
being duly made except by killing me.  I am
here, a self-confessed robber.  If I were in
your place, I should shoot.'
</p>

<p>
'The cowardice of the west, you see,' Lavendale
remarked, throwing his revolver upon the
table.  'You had better get out of the room.
I might change my mind.'
</p>

<p>
For a moment Niko made no movement.
Suzanne rose to her feet and lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
'As a matter of curiosity,' she asked, 'tell
us why you returned, Baron?'
</p>

<p>
He bowed.
</p>

<p>
'The Empire performance is not over until
half-past eleven,' he explained, 'and it is barely
ten o'clock.  I had some faint misgivings as
to the resetting of the lock.  I came back to
examine it.  That is my answer.  You speak
now of curiosity.  I, too, have curiosity.  Will
you tell me how you knew that I had opened
the safe?'
</p>

<p>
She smiled and lifted her handkerchief for
a moment to her lips.  Niko's head was bent
as though in humiliation.
</p>

<p>
'It is so hard to outgrow one's errors,' he
sighed.
</p>

<p>
He looked towards Lavendale and Lavendale
pointed impatiently towards the door.  He
took a step or two in that direction, then he
paused.
</p>

<p>
'Sir,' he said, looking back, 'because your
methods are not mine, believe me that I still
can appreciate their mistaken chivalry.  The
information I have gained I shall use.  No
promise of mine to the contrary would avail
you.  But there is, perhaps, some return which
I might offer, more valuable, perhaps, to
mademoiselle, yet of some import to you also.'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne leaned a little forward.  Her cigarette
burnt idly between her fingers.
</p>

<p>
'In this great conflict,' Niko continued,
'whose reverberations shake the earth, Japan
watches from afar off.  There are few who
know the reason, but there is a reason.  Let
that pass.  My country lays no seal upon my
lips.  What I know I pass on to you.  A
hundred million cartridges and five thousand
tons of heavier ammunition, which might
otherwise have reached Russia, are lying now at the
bottom of the ocean.  This is the doing of one
man, a man in the pay of Germany, a man who
is the greatest traitor the world has ever known.'
</p>

<p>
'Ossendorf!' Suzanne cried.
</p>

<p>
Niko bowed and moved towards the door.
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle has suspected, perhaps,' he
concluded.  'It is I who can assure her that
her suspicions are just.  The greatest plant in
America is kept producing munitions by day
and night, bought with Russian gold but never
meant to reach their destination.  It is well?'
</p>

<p>
He looked at Lavendale, his hand upon the
door.  Lavendale nodded curtly.
</p>

<p>
'It is well,' he said.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jacob P. Weald smoothed out the
document which he had been examining and drew
a deep sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
'Say, Ed,' he remarked, turning to his
secretary, who was smoking a cigar at the other
end of the room, 'that's worth a cool million
apiece for us, that contract.'
</p>

<p>
'Hope there's no hitch,' the other replied
anxiously.  'What's this young fellow from
the Embassy want?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing to hurt us,' Weald assured him.
'We're all right with the authorities all round.
I'm glad, Ed, we did the square thing.  We've
had it straight from the British War Office
to go right along ahead and give Russia
everything we can turn out.  Well, Russia's going
to have it, and, by gum, there's enough
ammunition provided for in that contract to make
mincemeat of the whole German Army!'
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door of the sitting-room
and a servant announced Mr. Ambrose
Lavendale.  Lavendale, following closely
behind, shook hands at once with the two men.
</p>

<p>
'I've heard of your plant, Mr. Weald,' he
said pleasantly.  'Wonderful things you've been
doing in the way of producing ammunition,
they tell me.  Been unlucky some with your
shipments, though, haven't you?'
</p>

<p>
'That's so,' the other admitted, 'but that's
not our fault.  We don't come in there.  Our
friends have their own steamships, eleven of
them, bought for the job.'
</p>

<p>
'Lost two out of three already, haven't
they?' Lavendale remarked.
</p>

<p>
'Say, you seem some wise, young man,'
Mr. Weald said pleasantly.  'However, I got
the note from the boss.  What can we do for you?'
</p>

<p>
'A very small thing,' Lavendale replied.
'I understand that Baron Ossendorf is coming
here to sign that contract at twelve o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
'You're dead right, sir,' Mr. Weald admitted,
'and there's a magnum of the best standing
there in the ice, waiting for the psychological
moment.'
</p>

<p>
'Mind my being present and asking him
one question&mdash;just one?' Lavendale inquired.
</p>

<p>
'We ain't likely to object to anything you
want to do, young fellow,' Mr. Weald assured
him.  'Ed Jenkins there&mdash;he's secretary of
the company&mdash;and I, have got no crooked
ideas about this business.  We are going to
bring a few million dollars into our own pockets,
but we are going to do it on the straight.
What our Ambassador over here says, goes,
and his note asks us to take you into this.'
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door.  Ossendorf
was announced and promptly entered.  He
held out a hand each to Weald and Jenkins.
Then he glanced inquiringly at Lavendale.
</p>

<p>
'This is a young friend of ours from the
American Embassy,' Mr. Weald explained.
'Mr. Ambrose Lavendale&mdash;Baron Ossendorf.
He's a kind of witness that all's right and
above-board.'
</p>

<p>
Baron Ossendorf bowed and held out his
long, elegantly-shaped hand.
</p>

<p>
'I am delighted, Mr. Lavendale,' he said,
'delighted that you should be a participator
in our little business this morning.  Between
Russia and America there have always been
the most cordial sentiments of friendship.  It
is a pleasure to us to think that we are able,
at these terrible times, to be of service to one
another....  You have the contract,
Mr. Weald?  Ah!' he added, glancing at it
through his eyeglass, 'I see that this is the
draft which I have already perused.  Nothing
remains, then, but for me to sign it.'
</p>

<p>
He dipped his pen in the ink, stooped down
and there was a moment's silence whilst his
pen spluttered across the paper.  Mr. Weald
began to cut the strings of the magnum of
champagne.
</p>

<p>
'Just one moment,' Lavendale interposed.
'There is a little condition, Baron, which it is
not proposed to put officially into the agreement,
a very small matter, but may I suggest it to you?'
</p>

<p>
Ossendorf turned his head.  His eyes had
narrowed a little.
</p>

<p>
'By all means, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'The contract,' Lavendale continued slowly,
'is for the whole production of the Weald
Plant for six months, with option of continuance
until the end of the war.  Shipments are to be
made weekly by steamers whose names are
given there, steamers practically acquired by
the Russian Government.'
</p>

<p>
'You are well informed, my young friend,'
Ossendorf admitted quietly.
</p>

<p>
'It has been suggested,' Lavendale said,
speaking slowly and looking Ossendorf in
the face, 'that you should change the wireless
operator on all those vessels for a person
approved by the British Government.'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's deep silence.  Mr. Weald
had paused with his knife already pressed
against the last string of the bottle.  Jenkins
was standing with his mouth open, a little
dazed.  Ossendorf shrank back as though he
had received a blow.  It was obvious that
he retained his composure with an effort.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?' he demanded.
</p>

<p>
'Simply this,' Lavendale replied firmly.
'Already the <i>Iris</i> and the <i>Southern Star</i>, with
enough ammunition on board to have supplied
an army, have gone to the bottom.  I mean,
sir, that every one of those remaining nine
boats on which is to be packed the whole
production of the greatest ammunition plant in
America, is doomed to go to the bottom.'
</p>

<p>
Two great drops of sweat had broken out on
Ossendorf's forehead.  His face seemed
suddenly to have grown thinner.  His mouth was
open.  He glared at Lavendale, but he was
utterly incapable of speech.  The latter turned
to Weald.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Weald,' he said, 'this contract for
your entire output can be signed within twenty-four
hours, either by a representative of Russia
other than Baron Ossendorf, or by the
secretary of the British Munition Board.  This
man Ossendorf is a paid traitor&mdash;the Judas
of the war.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weald was incapable of coherent speech.
</p>

<p>
'You mean,' Jenkins faltered, 'that he is
in the pay of Germany?'
</p>

<p>
'Ask him!' Lavendale suggested scornfully.
</p>

<p>
Ossendorf seemed to wither up.  He staggered
to his feet and groped to the door.
Suddenly something flashed in his hands, clasped
tightly between them.  There was a loud
report, the room seemed filled with smoke.
They all three looked in a dazed manner at
the figure stretched upon the carpet, face
downwards, the shoulders still twitching slightly.
Lavendale stood with his finger upon the bell.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to have interfered, Mr. Weald,' he said,
'but your stuff's wanted somewhere else&mdash;not
at the bottom of the sea.' ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ossendorf's body was carried away.  It
was very well understood that the matter was
to be hushed up.  Lavendale lingered with
Mr. Weald, who was walking restlessly about
the room, still scarcely able to realize what
had happened.
</p>

<p>
'Poor devil!' he kept on muttering.  'Poor devil!'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale laid his hand firmly upon his
compatriot's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Mr. Weald,' he said, 'there are
good and bad of every nation&mdash;Germans,
Americans, English, or French.  This man was outside
the pale.  He was a black and dastardly traitor,
the pariah of humanity, he trafficked with the
lives of human beings, he was a murderer for
gold.  If anything, his end was too merciful.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weald nodded reflectively.  Lavendale's
words were convincing.  His eyes wandered
towards the champagne bottle upon the
sideboard.  He was feeling the strain.
</p>

<p>
'In that case,' he murmured, 'perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
GENERAL MATRAVERS REPAYS
</h3>

<p>
Mademoiselle Suzanne de
Freyne was travelling back to England
in hot haste.  On the French train she
received courtesies rarely extended in these
days to any solitary passenger, and at Boulogne
she was hurried from the gangway of the steamer
back on to the dock and into an evil-looking,
four-funnelled British destroyer.  Almost as
she set foot on board, they moved away from
the landing-stage.  An officer came forward
to meet her and saluted.
</p>

<p>
'The Captain's cabin is at your disposal,
Miss de Freyne,' he announced.  'We have
an invalided General on board, but we've tucked
him up in a bunk.  Afraid we shall give you a
bit of a shaking up.'
</p>

<p>
'I am a very good sailor,' Suzanne assured
him.  'It is delightful that I am able to come
across with you.  Time counts for so much,
these days.'
</p>

<p>
'We haven't any stewardess,' the young
officer remarked, as he threw open the door
of the cabin.  'You'll ring the bell for anything
you want, though.  Parsons is an awfully good
fellow.  And you'll excuse me, won't you?
I'm on duty.'
</p>

<p>
He hurried up on deck, and in a few moments
the destroyer was clear of the harbour and
tearing across the Channel into the sombre
blackness of the night.  Huge waves, with a
thunderous roar, swept her decks.  The spray
leapt high above the tops of her squat funnels,
from which flashed little jets of flame.  Suzanne,
driven from the cabin by the craving for air,
stood half-way up the companion-way, looking
into the blackness.  Here and there, a star
seemed to reel across the face of the sky and
more than once a cloud of spray swept over her
head.  Unhesitatingly, as though driven by
some superhuman hand, they ploughed their
way through the black wall of space to their
destination.  After the turmoil of the Channel,
their slow gliding up to the side of the dock
seemed almost ghostlike.  Suzanne felt almost
as though she herself were breathless as she
stood at last upon the soaking deck.  There
were a couple of dim lights and a few shadowy
figures upon the quay.  The young officer who
had spoken to her at Boulogne, stood by her side.
</p>

<p>
'We are throwing a gangway across for you,
Miss de Freyne.  I'm afraid we gave you
rather a rough crossing.
</p>

<p>
'I do not mind it,' she declared.  'I was
only anxious to come quickly.  Do you know
if I shall be able to get on to London at once?'
</p>

<p>
'There will be a special for the General,'
he told her.  'They'll probably take you, too.'
</p>

<p>
The gangway was thrown across.  The young
man saluted, and Suzanne stepped on to the
rain-sodden dock.  An official stepped up to
her at once.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Yes?'
</p>

<p>
'There is a special waiting here for General
Matravers.  I have had instructions to attach
a coach for you.'
</p>

<p>
'That is very delightful!' she exclaimed.
'Shall I follow you?'
</p>

<p>
The man piloted her across the track and
handed her into an ordinary first-class
compartment attached to the waiting train.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry we've had to give the saloon to
General Matravers,' he explained.  'Will you
have any tea or coffee, or anything to eat?'
</p>

<p>
She gave an order to the refreshment boy
whom he summoned, and threw herself down
with a sigh of content into the corner seat.
Presently a tall man in khaki, with his arm in
a sling and leaning upon a stick, came up the
platform, followed by two junior officers.  He
was shown at once into the saloon and a little
murmur of animated conversation arose.  Five
minutes later the train glided away, leaving the
two junior officers disconsolate upon the long,
wooden platform; passed through the two
stations, and, gathering speed at every moment,
rushed away northwards.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne had more than once boasted that
she had no nerves.  She finished her coffee
and sandwiches, lit a cigarette and curled herself
up in her corner.  For a few moments she
looked out into the darkness, watching the
scanty lights.  Then her eyes turned, entirely
by chance, towards the door which connected
her carriage with the saloon.  They had no
sooner rested upon it than a queer, inexplicable
sense of uneasiness crept over her.  She tried
to look away from it, to look out of the opposite
window, to interest herself in the evening paper.
She read a line or two, then found herself slowly
lowering the sheet, found herself peering over
the top towards that closed door of dark red
mahogany with its brass handle.  She threw
the paper down, walked to the end of the
carriage and back again.  She must be going mad,
she told herself.  The only occupant of that
saloon was a wounded soldier of great distinction,
a General whose deeds in the earlier stages
of the war had made history.  He was alone
there without even an A.D.C., and in any case
the door was probably locked.  What cause of
uneasiness for her could there be in his
proximity?  She fought against her fit of nerves
valiantly, but she found herself tearing the paper
into small pieces, crumbling the remains of her
roll between her fingers, sipping desperately
the remnants of her cold coffee.  And all the
time her eyes seemed glued upon that brass
door-knob.  If it should move!  She set her
teeth to keep from screaming.  When the
thing really happened, it seemed to bring, to a
certain extent, release from her hysterical fears.
Yet for the first few seconds it paralyzed her.
The handle turned, slowly and deliberately.
The door was pushed open towards her.  A
man looked in, stooping by reason of his height,
a lean, gaunt man clad in the uniform of a
General.  He looked at her for a moment
without speech.  Then he came into the
compartment and closed the door behind him.
</p>

<p>
'What do you want?' she asked hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
He saluted mechanically.
</p>

<p>
'I am General Matravers,' he announced.
'May I sit down?'
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the communication
cord&mdash;it was on the distant side of the carriage.  Why
she should have been afraid of him she could not
tell, yet she felt as though she had never been
in such danger in her life as when he took the
seat opposite to her.
</p>

<p>
'I am General Matravers,' he repeated.
'You have heard of me, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'But naturally,' she assented.  'We have
all read of your wonderful exploits at Mons.'
</p>

<p>
He moistened his lips with his tongue.  His
face seemed curiously dried up, his eyes were
hard, his features grim and bony.  He presented
somehow a queer impression of lifelessness.
</p>

<p>
'Mons!' he muttered ruminatingly.
'You've never been to Hell, have you, young lady?'
</p>

<p>
'Not yet,' she answered, watching him closely.
</p>

<p>
'That was the beginning of it,' he went on.
'We need a Dante, young lady, to sing to us
of those days, when the winds were driven
from the face of the earth by the screeching
of the shells and the roar and the clash of the
guns, and they seemed to be always nearer....
Every foot of ground was red with blood,
the blood of our dear soldiers, and one thought
of the people at home....  I know men who
lost their reason at Mons.'
</p>

<p>
'It must have been terrible,' she faltered.
</p>

<p>
He sat opposite to her, nervously opening
and closing the interlocked fingers of his hands.
</p>

<p>
'You know why I am coming home?'
he asked abruptly.  'Medals enough here, you
see, for a field-marshal, and I am sent home in
disgrace.'
</p>

<p>
She murmured something to which he paid
no attention whatever.
</p>

<p>
'I left my two A.D.C.'s at Folkestone,' he
went on, 'forbade them to enter the train.
They are worried about me.  Perhaps they are
right.  You see, it was at&mdash;but we don't
mention names&mdash;my headquarters last week.
It was the night before our advance.  You
read about that.  I won't mention the name
of the place.  We called it a partial success.
But for the thing I am going to tell you, it
might have been the turning point of the war.
The attack failed&mdash;my fault.'
</p>

<p>
'I read that your division did splendidly,'
she remarked.
</p>

<p>
Again he moistened his dry lips.  His hands
were shaking now by his side; he seemed like
a man on the verge of paralysis.
</p>

<p>
'This is what happened,' he continued. 'I
was at headquarters, my own headquarters.
My orderly reported a Staff Officer from the
French headquarters.  He came in, a
typical-looking young French soldier, wearing the
uniform of one of their best regiments, one of those
which I knew were in the division which was
to join up with ours in the morning.  He was
tall and dark, with a thin, black moustache,
long, narrow eyes, a scar on his right cheek,
sallow, and with a queer habit of swinging his
left arm.  He brought me some intelligible,
perfectly coherent verbal instructions, asked a
few questions as to my plans for the next day,
gave me a personal message from the French
General commanding the division, saluted, got
back into his motor-car and drove off.  And
I thought no more about it until we found out
that our whole scheme of attack was known
to the enemy, and that they were prepared for
us at every point.  He was a German.  We
were sold.  Thousands of my men were lost
through that.  My fault.  He was a German.
Are you a German, young lady?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, but no!' she exclaimed, shrinking a little
back.
</p>

<p>
'You are not wholly English.'
</p>

<p>
'I am half French and half English,' she
told him.
</p>

<p>
'The French are good people,' he went on,
relapsing into his former far-away tone, 'very
fine people.  They can fight too, and they can
tell Germans when they see them.  That is
why I am going home&mdash;because I couldn't.
I've sworn that the next German I see, I'll
kill.  You're not a German, are you?'
</p>

<p>
'I told you just now,' she reminded him
quietly, 'that I am half French and half
English&mdash;mostly French.  I am in the service
of the French Government at the present
moment, trying to help you, General.'
</p>

<p>
'Good girl,' he said absently.  'I thought
there might have been a German in here when
I heard some one moving.  If I can't find one,
I suppose I must shoot myself.'
</p>

<p>
He took out a little revolver and examined it.
He opened the breech and she saw that it was
fully loaded.
</p>

<p>
'May I look?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
He handed it to her at once.  The window
by which they sat was half down.  She calmly
threw it out.  He looked at her in a
mildly-vexed manner.
</p>

<p>
'You should not have done that, young
lady,' he expostulated.  'I was very fond
of that revolver.  Besides, how am I to kill
myself now?'
</p>

<p>
'I should wait,' she advised him.  'When
you get to London you will easily find
Germans&mdash;too many of them.'
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'But I've nothing to kill them with, and
I've left my army behind.  I am sent home,'
he added, with a sudden hoarse pathos.
</p>

<p>
Her sense of personal fear had passed.  She
knew that the dangerous moment, if indeed
there had been one, lay behind.
</p>

<p>
'There is so much work to be done in England,'
she said.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be looking through the
carriage windows; his hands were twitching
horribly.
</p>

<p>
'Those nights,' he muttered, 'when we
thought that an hour's rest had come, and the
red fires came spitting from our flanks just when
we thought ourselves safe, when we thought
them far and away behind&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
His words became unintelligible.  He sat
quite quiet.  Presently, to her joy, she saw a
carpet of lights on either side and knew that
they were running into London.
</p>

<p>
'You had better get back to your saloon,'
she said.  'We shall be at Charing Cross in a
few minutes, and there will probably be some
one to meet you.'
</p>

<p>
He rose obediently to his feet.  The tears
were in her eyes as he turned away with a stiff
little salute, and, stooping low, disappeared
through the doorway.  Then she leaned back
with a long-drawn sigh of relief.  It was a
strange little episode, another of the little
adventures which gave colour to her life.  She
leaned out of the window and saw the last of
him as they drew up.  He was met by an officer
and an elderly lady.  She saw him pass out and
take his place in a waiting motor-car.  Then
she stepped out herself, handed her bag to a
porter and was conducted to a taxicab.
</p>

<br />
</p>

<p>
Suzanne sat, the next afternoon, under the
trees at Ranelagh with Lavendale.  She leaned
back in her chair and breathed a little sigh of
contentment.
</p>

<p>
'And you, my friend,' she asked, 'what
have you been doing?
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' he answered.  I am waiting
for a man to arrive from America.  His coming,
I fancy, will provide me with work, but until
then there is nothing for me.  To pass the time
while you were in France, I went over to
Holland last week.'
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
'The one country left which may provide
us with a sensation,' she remarked.  'I suppose
that is why you went.'
</p>

<p>
'I made a few inquiries,' he replied.  'My
own impression of the people was that they
wanted peace very badly and Schnapps more
than anything else in the world.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly.  It was significant of
his attitude towards her that he asked no
questions of her own doings.
</p>

<p>
'I had a curious adventure on my way back
from Paris yesterday,' she told him.  'I
travelled up from Boulogne in a special with
General Matravers.'
</p>

<p>
'Matravers?' he repeated.  'Isn't he one
of the British Generals who have been sent
home?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe so,' she assented, 'in fact I am
sure of it.  He told me the whole story on the
way up.  Afterwards he brought out a revolver
and swore that he was going to shoot himself.'
</p>

<p>
'What on earth did you do?' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'I took it away from him,' she replied.
'He wasn't in the least dangerous, really.'
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' Lavendale declared earnestly,
'I think it's quite time you left off this
travelling about alone.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed gaily.
</p>

<p>
'But, my friend,' she protested, 'what would
you have?  Can a trusted agent'&mdash;she glanced
around for a moment and lowered her voice&mdash;'of
the French and English Secret Service
engage a chaperon?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't care,' he answered, a little doggedly.
'It's all very well for us men to take a risk or
two, but it's no sort of life for a girl&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She checked him at once.
</p>

<p>
'You don't understand,' she interrupted.
'I am a daughter of France.  Every drop of
blood in my body, every part of myself, my soul,
even, belongs to my country.  The work I am
doing I shall go on with, whatever it might
cost me.'
</p>

<p>
He did not attempt to argue with her, the
finality of her tone was too absolute.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose it is because of this spirit,' he
said, 'that France is invincible.  Tell me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He broke off in his sentence.  Her fingers
had suddenly gripped his arm, she had leaned
forward in her place.  Coming down the steps
on to the terrace was a little group of soldiers
in staff uniform.  One of them, in the centre
of the group, was obviously a foreigner, and,
from the respect with which they all treated
him, a person of distinction.
</p>

<p>
'Who are they?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I expect they are members of the military
mission from France,' he explained.  'They
are being entertained down here to dinner
to-night by some officials from the War Office.
The head-waiter told me about it.  I tackled
him about a table in case you cared to stay
down.'
</p>

<p>
'But only one of them is a foreigner,' she
observed.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'I really don't know anything more about
it,' he said.  'I don't suppose any one does.
Why are you so interested?'
</p>

<p>
She said nothing for a moment.  The Frenchman
was standing chatting amiably in the
centre of the terrace, and Suzanne watched
him with curious intensity.  He was tall, he
had a slight black moustache, his eyes were
long and narrow, there was a scar on his right
cheek.  He was the very prototype of the
man who had arisen in her mind a few hours
ago, called into being by those hoarse,
broken-hearted words of the ruined General.
</p>

<p>
'I must know his name,' she insisted.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
'But, my dear&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I must know his name,' she repeated.
'Please help me.  Don't ask me why.'
</p>

<p>
He rose at once.
</p>

<p>
'I'll do my best,' he promised her.
</p>

<p>
He disappeared into the house.  The little
party of men strolled backwards and forwards
along the terrace.  In about five minutes
Lavendale reappeared.  He smiled as he approached.
</p>

<p>
'I got hold of the dinner cards,' he announced
in triumph.  'His name is Lieutenant-Colonel
Leychelles.'
</p>

<p>
The little company of soldiers at that moment
began to descend the steps.  Suzanne rose to
her feet and, standing under the shadow of the
trees, she leaned forward.  The man whom
she had been watching with so much interest,
was distinctly swinging his left arm.  She
gripped Lavendale by the elbow.
</p>

<p>
'Come with me,' she insisted.  'Come with
me at once.  Take me up to town.'
</p>

<p>
He obeyed promptly.  They passed through
the house and Lavendale ordered up his car.
</p>

<p>
'Where to?' he asked, as he took his place
at the driving wheel.
</p>

<p>
'I must find General Matravers,' she declared.
'Drive up towards London.  I must think as
we go.'
</p>

<p>
They glided down the drive, over Hammersmith
Bridge and up to the Park.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you belong to a club somewhere?'
she asked.  'We must get a Who's Who.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, of course,' he answered.  'We can
manage that easily enough.'
</p>

<p>
He pulled up presently outside the door of
the Bath Club in Dover Street.
</p>

<p>
'If you'll wait here for half a moment,' he
suggested.
</p>

<p>
She nodded and he sprang down and ran
lightly up the steps.  He was back again almost
at once.
</p>

<p>
'The first name I came across,' he
announced,&mdash;'17 Belgrave Square is the town address.
Shall I drive there?  It's quite close.'
</p>

<p>
She assented.  In a few moments they
arrived at their destination.  Suzanne stood
under the stone portico and rang the bell.  In
due course a butler appeared.
</p>

<p>
'General Matravers is not seeing anybody,
madam,' was his prompt reply to Suzanne's
inquiry.  'The doctor has ordered him complete rest.'
</p>

<p>
'My business,' Suzanne explained, 'is very
urgent.'
</p>

<p>
'So every reporter who has been here to-day
has told me,' the man replied a little wearily.
No one has been allowed to see him.'
</p>

<p>
'Is Lady Matravers in?' Suzanne persisted.
</p>

<p>
'Lady Matravers is not receiving.  Perhaps
you would like to leave your name and a
message, madam?' the man suggested.
</p>

<p>
A tall, dark-haired woman, who had been
crossing the hall, paused.  She came a few
steps towards Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
'I am Lady Matravers,' she announced,
'Can I do anything for you?'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne pressed forward and the butler
stood on one side.
</p>

<p>
'Lady Matravers,' the former said earnestly,
I have the most important business with your
husband.  I know he is ill&mdash;I came up from
Folkestone with him yesterday&mdash;and yet I
must see him.'
</p>

<p>
'You were his companion in the special
train?' Lady Matravers asked.  'He spoke
of a young lady who travelled up with him.'
</p>

<p>
'I am the young lady,' Suzanne assented.
'I am in the Secret Service of France,' she went
on, dropping her voice a little.  'Your husband
told me some curious things last night.  It is
in connection with one of them that I wish to
see him.  It isn't for my own sake, Lady
Matravers.  It is for the sake of the country.'
</p>

<p>
The door was thrown open.  General Matravers,
leaning upon his stick, came into the
hall.  He was looking very white and shaken,
but he seemed to recognize Suzanne.  He
looked at her doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
'It is the young lady whom I found last night
in the carriage attached to my saloon,' he
remarked, 'the young lady, my dear,' he added,
turning to his wife, 'who threw my revolver
out of the window.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Matravers glanced towards the servant
who was lingering in the background and led
Suzanne back into the room from which she
herself had issued.  The General followed her.
A quiet-faced woman in nurse's uniform rose
from a chair as they entered.
</p>

<p>
'If you are really the young lady who
travelled with my husband from Folkestone last
night,' Lady Matravers said kindly, 'I am
very glad indeed to meet you.  He has told
me such very nice things about you.  The
doctor's orders are that he is not to be disturbed
on any account, but if you wish to speak to
him for a few minutes, here he is.  I was
just trying to persuade him to go to bed when
you came.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps what I have come to say may do
your husband more good than harm,' Suzanne
assured her.  'General,' she added, turning
towards him, 'do you mind describing to me
once more the man who came to your headquarters
masquerading as a French officer, an
envoy from the French Brigadier-General?'
</p>

<p>
The General's face darkened.
</p>

<p>
'Describe him!' he exclaimed.  'Why, I
can't get him out of my thoughts for a minute!
He was tall, soldierly, dark, sallow, black
moustache, narrow eyes, black hair cut short,
a scar on his right cheek, and he had a habit
swinging his left arm when he walked.'
</p>

<p>
'I need not ask you whether you would know
him again,' Suzanne said, 'because I am sure
you would.  I may be very foolish and I may
be making a very silly mistake, but there is a
man over here now attached to the French
Military Mission.  He is being entertained
to-night at Ranelagh by officials from the War
Office.  He leaves to-morrow, ostensibly for
French headquarters, and he answers your
description exactly.'
</p>

<p>
All the nervousness had left the General's
manner.  He was perfectly calm, a little eager.
He picked up his cap and cane from a table.
</p>

<p>
'Where is he to be found?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'If you will come with me,' Suzanne
promised, 'I will take you to him.'
</p>

<p>
The nurse hastened towards them.  The
General pushed her aside.  His tone had
acquired a new firmness.
</p>

<p>
'Please understand, both of you,' he said,
'that no nurse or doctor's injunctions will keep
me from doing my duty.  My dear,' he added,
turning to his wife and kissing her upon the
forehead, 'this is not a matter in which you
must interfere.  If the young lady is mistaken,
I shall come back at once.  If by any chance
she is right, it is imperative that I should go.
I am at your service, madam.'
</p>

<p>
'I will take care of him,' Suzanne whispered
to Lady Matravers.
</p>

<p>
They let him go, doubtfully but of compulsion.
He took his place in the car and acknowledged
his introduction to Lavendale with a stiff salute.
They started off at once.  For the first time
Suzanne began to be a little nervous about the
outcome of their journey.
</p>

<p>
'This man,' she explained, 'is being
entertained at dinner at Ranelagh at the present
moment.  We can go down there and you can
see from the open doorway of the dining-room
whether there is any truth in my suspicions.
If we are wrong&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You need have no fear, young lady,' the
General assured her calmly.  'I am a member
of Ranelagh and well-known there.  It will
be quite in order that I stroll round the place
and glance in at the dining-room.  If your
suspicions are, as you suggest, ill-founded,
no harm will be done.  If they are true,' he
added, his voice shaking for a moment, 'if
really it is vouchsafed to me in this life to
find myself face to face once more with that
man&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly and muttered
something under his breath.  Not another word
was spoken until they had turned in at the
avenue and pulled up in front of the clubhouse.
The General had become preternaturally calm.
He waited, however, for Suzanne to precede him.
</p>

<p>
'If you will lead the way, young lady,' he
suggested.
</p>

<p>
They crossed through the two rooms, out on
to the terrace the other side, and turned towards
the dining-room.  The gardens were bright
with flowers, and the glow of the sunset seemed
still to linger about the place.  One or two
visitors who had dined early were already
having their coffee under the trees.  From a
hidden spot the musicians were tuning their
instruments.  Suzanne felt her heart beat
rapidly as they drew near the dining-room;
the General, apparently unmoved, walked with
measured tread, a commanding and dignified
figure.  A couple of young soldiers stood up
as he passed, and he accepted their salute
genially.  Then he passed into the dining-room.
Almost immediately in front of him,
at the table usually reserved for the golfers'
luncheon, the dinner-party was proceeding,
and on the right-hand side of the host sat
the distinguished Frenchman.  He was facing
the door and he glanced up at the entrance of
the little party.  Suzanne asked no questions.
She felt her breath almost stop, a little sob
choked her.  The faces of almost every one
in the room, the laughter, the murmur of
conversation, seemed suddenly in her mind to
have become arrested.  More than anything
else in the world she was conscious of this
one thing&mdash;the man who sat there knew that
his hour had come, knew that Fate was marching
towards him in the shape of that grim, military
figure.
</p>

<p>
The General walked towards the party very
much with the air of one who had come to
make some casual inquiry.  It was only when
he was recognized that a little interested
murmur stole around the room.  He walked
to within a few feet of the Frenchman and
his right hand seemed to have disappeared
for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Gentlemen,' he said, without unduly raising
his voice but with curious distinctness, 'the
man whom you are entertaining here as an
emissary from our French allies, is an
impostor, a German and a spy.  He cost me,
a few weeks ago, the lives of two thousand of
my men.  A far smaller thing, he is responsible
for the ruin of my reputation.  This is less
than he deserves.'
</p>

<p>
With hand as steady as a rock, the General
held his revolver out before him and deliberately
fired three times at the man whom he had
accused, and who had fallen forward now, his
outstretched hands sweeping the wineglasses
from in front of him&mdash;stone dead.  The General
watched his victim without emotion.  He even
leaned forward to make sure that the wounds
were mortal.  Then he walked deliberately
out into the garden, heedless of the shrieking
of the women, the crowd of diners who had
sprung to their feet, the passing of the paralysis
which had seemed to keep every one in the
room seated and silent.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
They found the proofs upon his body that
night&mdash;horrifying, stupefying proofs&mdash;and the
censor's hand came down.  No word of that
tragedy ever appeared under any sensational
headline in any newspaper.  In the face of
that grim silence, even many of those who had
been present found themselves wondering
whether that lightning tragedy had not been a
nightmare of the brain.  To Suzanne de Freyne,
however, it remained always one of the tense
moments of her life.  The General, with the
revolver still in his hand, turned towards her
with a polite gesture and a happy smile as he
led the way into the garden.  He tossed the
weapon into a bed of geraniums and seemed
utterly indifferent to the turmoil around.
</p>

<p>
'You were right, young lady,' he said.  'That
was the man.'

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
SUSCEPTIBLE MR. KESSNER
</h3>

<p>
There was a vigour in her walk, a determination
in her face, which made Lavendale
pause for an instant before he crossed the street
to accost Suzanne de Freyne.  It was perfectly
clear to him that she was bound upon a serious
errand.  She was dressed with her usual subdued
elegance but with more, even, than her usual
simplicity.  In her black tailor-made costume,
her small hat and neat patent shoes, she looked
like the Rue de la Paix at four o'clock in the
afternoon during its halcyon days.  He was
forced to quicken his pace to intercept her.
</p>

<p>
'Good morning, Miss de Freyne!'
</p>

<p>
She turned quickly around and held out her
left hand.  Her greeting was cordial enough,
but her air of abstraction did not altogether
disappear.
</p>

<p>
'Where have you been hiding for the last
few days?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I came back from Holland last night,' he
replied.  'I have been in Germany again.'
</p>

<p>
'Any news?' she asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing very wonderful.  I needn't ask
how things are with you.  I can tell that you
have something on hand.  Can I help?'
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
'You are right in a way, but I don't think
you can help,' she told him.  'This is quite
an important morning&mdash;it is Celia's sale.'
</p>

<p>
He was a little staggered.  Her manner was
convincing.
</p>

<p>
'You mean that you are going to a millinery
sale?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be silly,' she answered.  'The first
morning of Celia's sale is the most important
event of the season.  We have printed cards of
invitation, and policemen outside the door to
keep away intruders.  This isn't any ordinary
bargain hunting, you know.  This is our one
chance to provide ourselves with the elegancies
of life at a reasonable cost.'
</p>

<p>
'For the moment, I gather,' he went on,
falling into step with her, 'the affairs of the
nation are in the background.'
</p>

<p>
'Naturally,' she assented.
</p>

<p>
'At what hour,' he inquired, 'will this
function be over?'
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'If I thought you were making fun&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Never entered into my head,' he assured her.
</p>

<p>
'Then you can give me some lunch at one
o'clock,' she promised.
</p>

<p>
'That's exactly what I was hoping for.  And,
Miss de Freyne?'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Would you mind very much if I brought
an acquaintance?'
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Of course not,' she answered, 'only it must
be a grill-room luncheon, please.  I am dressed
for a scrimmage.'
</p>

<p>
'At one o'clock at the Milan Grill,' he told
her, raising his hat.
</p>

<p>
He strolled slowly away southwards, crossed
Pall Mall, and let himself in by a side entrance
to the American Embassy.  Here he spent a
few minutes in the outer offices and passed on,
a little later, into a more private apartment.
An elderly man with a clean-shaven face, grey
hair brushed back from his forehead, and
tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles, looked up from
his roll-topped desk and waved his visitor to
a seat.
</p>

<p>
'Hullo, Ambrose!  Anything fresh?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale drew up a chair and grasped the
hand which the other offered him.
</p>

<p>
'There is plenty going on, if one could get
to understand it, Mr. Washburn,' he said.
'Berlin had me puzzled.'
</p>

<p>
'When did you get back?'
</p>

<p>
'Last night.'
</p>

<p>
'See anything of our friend?'
</p>

<p>
'He crossed with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Get acquainted with him?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  I knew him before in Washington and
in New York,' Lavendale replied.  'I took care
to remind him of it, too.  Yes, he was quite
friendly.  All the same, he was secretive.  He
didn't tell me the one thing I discovered of
the greatest interest in connection with his
trip, and that was that the Kaiser sent his
private car three hundred miles and met him
at the Western Headquarters.  They spent
the best part of the day together.  Has he been
in here?'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Washburn shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'He neither reported before he left, nor has
he been in since he got back.  Kind of giving
us the cold shoulder, isn't it?'
</p>

<p>
'He hasn't had much time yet,' Lavendale
remarked thoughtfully, 'but it certainly doesn't
look exactly like the behaviour of a loyal
American.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Washburn turned in his place, removed
his spectacles from his eyes and rubbed them
carefully with his handkerchief.  A slight
weariness was apparent in his face and tone.
</p>

<p>
'That's our great trouble, Ambrose,' he said.
'Germany's a mighty country.  She holds her
sons in a closer grip than any other nation
in the world.  A German-American is a German
first and an American afterwards, and don't
you forget it.  That's what makes us such a
polyglot, indiscriminate race.  Are you going
to make a report?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at present,' Lavendale replied.  'I
haven't yet pieced together the scraps I was
able to pick up.  Let it be for a day or two.
What I am anxious to find out is whether
Kessner reports here or not, and what account
he gives, if any, of his journey to Germany.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll send you word directly he shows up,
if he comes at all,' Mr. Washburn promised.
'I hear there are half-a-dozen more of his
gang in London.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded.
</p>

<p>
'They've some sort of a show on.  Kessner
as good as admitted it to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Where do you stand with him?' Mr. Washburn
asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
'I'm all right up to the present,' Lavendale
asserted.  'He believes I went over on a mission
about the British prisoners, 'and he's inclined
to fancy I may be useful to him.  Anyway,
he is lunching with me to-day.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Washburn smiled.
</p>

<p>
'If you think you'll get much out of him,
young fellow,' he said, 'I fancy you're looking
for disappointment.  The brains that made
twenty million in Wall Street and control an
organization so secret that we can't even put
a finger upon it&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I know,' Lavendale interrupted, rising,
'but, you know, there's always chance to be
reckoned with, and I've one card up my sleeve,
anyway.  I know all about him and he doesn't
suspect me yet.' ...
</p>

<p>
'Exactly why am I asked to this festive
lunch?' Suzanne de Freyne inquired, as she
leaned back upon a settee in the small lounge
which led into the Milan grill-room, at a few
minutes before one o'clock that morning.
</p>

<p>
'Because I am up against a cul-de-sac,'
Lavendale confessed, 'and I want your woman's
wit to show me the way out.'
</p>

<p>
'You seem to be taking it for granted that
we are allies,' she remarked.
</p>

<p>
'We are to a certain extent,' he pleaded.
'You must admit that a Germanized United
States would be bad for you, and that is what
we have to fight against.'
</p>

<p>
A waiter set down two cocktails upon a small
table in front of them.  She sipped hers
deliberately.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, what is the trouble with this man
Kessner?' she asked.  'Of what is it that
you really suspect him?'
</p>

<p>
'I wish I knew,' Lavendale groaned.  'These
are the bald facts.  Washington and New
York, during the last six months, have been
the scene of the most desperate efforts of
German diplomacy and political manoeuvring,
with one sole aim&mdash;that of preventing the export
of munitions of war to England or France.
Money has been spent like water but the
progress has been too slow.  Germany has
gained adherents to her point of view, but not
enough.  America is in a position to be of
immense use to the Allies and none whatever
to Germany or Austria, and up to the present
she shows no signs of ceasing to supply England
and France and Russia with all the munitions
she can turn out.  The German Party in
America have taken stock of these things.
They have measured their weakness and tasted
defeat.  Everything up to this point has been
above-board.  We understood perfectly well
what they were fighting for, and to a certain
extent admitted their grievance.'
</p>

<p>
'They had no grievance,' Miss de Freyne
interposed.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps not a logical one,' Lavendale
admitted, 'but you see it is perfectly true that
while they are supplying munitions on an
immense scale to the Allies, they are supplying
none at all to Germany and Austria.  That
is, of course, owing to England's control of
the sea, but it is galling to Germany and
Austria to know that a neutral country is
providing her enemies with the means of waging
warfare against her.  From their point of view
it is not ideal neutrality, is it?'
</p>

<p>
'America is perfectly ready to supply Germany
and Austria as well,' she reminded him.
'Besides, Germany and Austria both supplied
England during the Boer War.'
</p>

<p>
'That, of course, is what makes America's
position logical,' he went on, 'but listen.
Kessner and his friends have obviously come
to an end of their intriguing in the direction
of stopping supplies.  They have dropped their
newspaper campaign.  They have shrugged
their shoulders and apparently accepted the
inevitable.  No one who knows them would
believe them capable of anything of the sort.
Kessner has been over here for a month.  He
was in Germany when I was.  He spent a
week with the Chancellor and a long time with
the Kaiser himself.  Heyl and both the
Hindemanns are over here, too.  They have also
been in Germany.  You see, they are all
entitled to call themselves Americans, although
they are Germans at heart.'
</p>

<p>
'You think that there is some fresh scheme
on?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I am perfectly certain there is,' he said
firmly.  'Not only that, but I have an idea
as to its bearing....  This is our friend.
If you don't know him by sight, prepare for
a shock.'
</p>

<p>
A small man, dressed in plain black clothes,
with broad-toed shoes and a tie almost clerical
in its simplicity, had entered the place and
was handing his bowler hat to an attendant.
His complexion was sallow, his general air
one of complete insignificance.  Suzanne
watched the greeting between the two with
intense interest.  It was hard to realize that
this was Ludwig Kessner, twenty times a
millionaire.
</p>

<p>
The little man's speech and manners wholly
belied his appearance.  His assurance was
unlimited.  He talked easily and with confidence.
</p>

<p>
'Well, young fellow,' he exclaimed, 'so
we are back in London, eh?  Not late, am I?'
</p>

<p>
'Not a moment,' Lavendale assured him.
'I want to present you, if I may, to Miss de
Freyne, who is lunching with us.  Miss de
Freyne,' he added, 'this is Mr. Kessner.'
</p>

<p>
She rose with a charming little smile and
shook hands with him.  Mr. Kessner seemed
to see no reason why he should conceal his
admiration.  He walked close to her side as
they entered the luncheon-room.
</p>

<p>
'Our young friend and I,' he remarked, 'were
hanging over the side of a steamer, looking
out for submarines, this time yesterday.  Not
particularly good for the appetite, that sort
of thing.'
</p>

<p>
'I think it is very brave of you to have
really crossed the North Sea,' Suzanne declared.
'I should have been terrified to death.'
</p>

<p>
'Business is business,' Mr. Kessner observed,
'and I am something of a fatalist myself.
I go about what I have to do and take my
chances.  Same with Mr. Lavendale, I expect,
only these diplomatists are used to it.
Troublous times, Miss de Freyne, times such as I
never dreamed we should see in our days.
By the by, are you French or English?'
</p>

<p>
'French, English, and Austrian,' she told
him, smiling, as they took their places at the
table, 'so you see I represent neutrality in
my own person.  My grandmother was Austrian,
and I have never been so happy as when I
lived in Vienna.'
</p>

<p>
He nodded approvingly.
</p>

<p>
'Do you know,' he said, 'I am glad you are
not altogether English.  I don't know which
way your sympathies may be in this trouble,
and I don't know as it matters.  We each
of us have a right to our feelings, whatever
they may be.  I am an American first and
foremost, like our friend here, only he has
British blood in his veins behind it, and I
have German.  We can keep good friends for
all that, though.'
</p>

<p>
'I think,' she sighed, 'that I am in a most
trying position.  I adore Austria and I have
many relations there.  I am very fond of
France and I have some good friends in England.
I am torn every way.  After all, though,' she
went on reflectively, 'it cannot be as hard
for me as for you.  You really are German,
are you not, and yet you have to sit still and
see America doing an enormous lot to help
the Allies.'
</p>

<p>
He glanced at her keenly.  Her sincerity
was undoubted.  Before he replied he looked
also at the occupants of the next two tables,
young people from the land of musical comedy
with their khaki-clad escorts, intellectually
negligible.  Nevertheless, he lowered his voice
a little as he answered.
</p>

<p>
'You are quite right, Miss de Freyne.  It
is one of the hardest nuts we have to crack,
we German-Americans.  We are honest and
above-board about it, you see.  We have worked
like slaves to direct the policy of America our
own way, and we've failed.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there nothing more you can do?' she
asked earnestly.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  Mr. Kessner,
with his napkin tucked in underneath his
chin, was settling down to his luncheon like
a man.  Nevertheless, he again glanced
searchingly at his neighbour.
</p>

<p>
'It is hard to see what can be done,' he said
calmly.  'I have been in Germany to visit
some of my relatives.  It is very wonderful
to hear them all talk there.  There is no
pessimism, no doubt whatever, no shadow of
misgiving.  Germany must win&mdash;that is in
their hearts.  They have not a single doubt.
And here in London, whether the people
deceive themselves or not, they say the same
thing.  They go about their business with
even more assurance, and they indulge in
pleasures far more freely.'
</p>

<p>
'Which is going to win?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Neither,' he replied.  'Neither has the
preponderance of strength to smash the other.
It will be a drawn fight.  There will be a
period of peace, nominal peace.  Germany knows
now what she has to face&mdash;a world in arms
against her.  When the next time comes, she
will be ready.'
</p>

<p>
'There will be a next time, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Germany is not yet at the end of her resources,'
he assured her.  'There are other ways in
which she can make herself felt.  But let
us leave for a little time these serious subjects.
This champagne, I know, my friend Lavendale,
is a compliment to me.  You English-Americans
do not drink champagne in the
middle of the day.  Believe me, you are wrong.
I drink your very good health, Miss de Freyne,
and yours, Lavendale.  And I drink also,'
he added, his eyes lightening a little as he
looked across the room, 'the unspoken toast!'
</p>

<p>
He set his glass down empty.
</p>

<p>
'There is an unspoken toast close to the heart
of all of us, Miss de Freyne,' he remarked,
'one little secret we keep at the back of our
thoughts.  Now tell me.  I sail on Saturday.
On Friday night you and our friend Lavendale
will give me the honour of your company
at dinner, eh?  It is arranged.  At the Ritz
at eight o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
'You are very kind,' they both murmured
</p>

<p>
He selected a cigar from a box which had
been passed him, and rose a little abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'I go to speak with a friend,' he said&mdash;'a
matter of business.  For your excellent luncheon
I thank you very much, and for the privilege
of having met Miss de Freyne,' he added with
a little bow, 'I thank you even more.  Till
Friday, then.'
</p>

<p>
He shuffled across the room, an ill-dressed,
undignified figure, yet with a confidence which
surpassed conceit.  They saw him greet a
compatriot and seat himself at the latter's
table.
</p>

<p>
'That man,' Lavendale said, as he toyed
with his coffee spoon, 'has at the back of his
head some new scheme.  It may not be directed
against your people.  I have an idea that it
is more likely to be directed against mine.'
</p>

<p>
'But he is an American himself,' she protested.
</p>

<p>
'He is a German-American,' Lavendale replied,
'which means that he is very much a German
and very little an American.'
</p>

<p>
'Whatever his new scheme may be,' she
sighed, 'I do not think that he is disposed
to talk about it.'
</p>

<p>
'Whatever it may be,' Lavendale replied,
'it is my business to find it out.  One thing
is absolutely certain.  No American would
receive the attentions of the Kaiser&mdash;in war
time, too&mdash;and come back here without a word
to say about it, unless there was something
in the background, something he meant to
keep secret.'
</p>

<p>
They strolled out into the entrance hall
and Lavendale departed in search of his hat.
A waiter came hurriedly out to Suzanne's
side.
</p>

<p>
'For madame,' he whispered, slipping a
little note into her hand.
</p>

<p>
Her fingers closed upon it quickly.  She
glanced around.  Lavendale was still talking
to some acquaintances.  She opened it and
read the few hastily pencilled lines:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
'<i>It would give me a great deal of pleasure
to see you again before Friday.  I am in flat
74 in the Court here.  Shall be alone all this
afternoon.</i>'
</p>

<p>
She crumpled up the note in her hand.
Lavendale was coming towards her.
</p>

<p>
'Can I take you anywhere?' he asked.
'The car will be outside.'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'Don't bother about me,' she said.  'I am
going up to my room to write some letters.'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
'Come in!'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne turned the handle of number seventy-four,
closed the door behind her and entered
the sitting-room.  Mr. Kessner turned around
in his chair from before a mass of papers.
He looked at Suzanne for an instant in surprise,
an expression which, as he recognized her,
changed quickly into one of satisfaction.  He
rose to his feet and came towards her.
</p>

<p>
'This is a great pleasure, my dear young
lady,' he said.  'I scarcely dared to hope&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He took her hands, but she evaded him with
a little smile.
</p>

<p>
'You see, we are neighbours almost,' she
explained.  'I have an apartment here when
I am in London.  I thought I would call in
and see you on the way to my room.  But,
please&mdash;do you mind?'
</p>

<p>
She pushed him gently away from her.  For
a moment his face darkened.  Then, with a
shrug of the shoulders, he threw himself into
the easy-chair opposite, a shapeless, ill-dressed
little morsel of humanity, with a queer intelligence
shining out of his narrowed eyes, suggested,
too, in the square forehead and puckered brows.
</p>

<p>
'Listen, young lady,' he said.  'Do you
know why I asked you to come and see me?'
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows and laughed at him.
</p>

<p>
'Because you like me, I hope,' she replied.
'For myself, I love making fresh acquaintances
amongst clever men.'
</p>

<p>
'Acquaintances?' he repeated slowly.
</p>

<p>
She nodded several times.
</p>

<p>
'I am not one of those,' she said, 'who can
gather the whole world in without a pause.
I like to make acquaintances.  Sometimes an
acquaintance may become a friend.  Sometimes&mdash;but
that takes time.'
</p>

<p>
She felt the steely light of his eyes upon her
and looked modestly down upon the carpet.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he went on, 'there were two reasons
why I sent for you.  One I think you have
surmised, and you keep it there at the back of
your pretty little head.  The other&mdash;well, you
are a young person of intelligence and mixed
nationality.  I thought it possible that you
might be of use to me.'
</p>

<p>
'But in what manner?' she demanded.
</p>

<p>
'I was frank with you at luncheon-time,'
he said.  'You know where my sympathies
lie.  Yours, I gathered, are divided.  Would
it be possible, I wonder, to induce you to look
my way?'
</p>

<p>
'But you yourself admitted,' she reminded
him, 'that the cause of Germany in America
is lost.  What more is there to be done?'
</p>

<p>
'Young lady,' he replied, 'the cause of
Germany in America may be lost for the
moment so far as regards our efforts to induce
the present administration to carry into effect
an ethical neutrality.  But the great source
of Germany's greatness is her capacity for
looking ahead.  If one cause is lost, then in
that day a new one is born.  If Germany had
not foreseen and prepared for this war for forty
years, she would have been crushed to-day.
Now we who are her sons in foreign countries,
our eyes, too, are fixed upon the future.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you have a new scheme,' she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
'We have a new scheme,' he admitted, 'but
what that may be it is not my intention to
tell you at present.'
</p>

<p>
She pouted at once.
</p>

<p>
'Of course, if you are not going to trust me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You must not be a foolish child,' he
interrupted.  'You would think little of me if I
did, and besides,' he added, rising to his feet,
'I am not sure yet that I do trust you.  Wait.'
</p>

<p>
He touched the bell.  Almost immediately
the door of the sitting-room was opened.  She
gave a little start.  An immense coloured man
in dark clothes stood respectfully in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
'George,' his master directed, 'if any one
rings, I am engaged.  See that I am not
disturbed on any pretext.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good, Mr. Kessner!
</p>

<p>
The man closed the door with wonderful
softness.  Even his footsteps, as he retreated
into the bedroom, were inaudible.  Kessner's
elbow was propped against the mantelpiece,
his head supported in his thin, yellow-stained
fingers.  He looked down at her.
</p>

<p>
'If you do not trust me,' she persisted, 'how
can I be of help to you?'
</p>

<p>
'I might put you to the test,' he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing distinctly threatening in
his tone, and yet all at once she was afraid.
The thought of that black Hercules loitering
outside, something in the downward droop
of the eyes of this man all the time edging a
little nearer to her, seemed suddenly to become
terrifying.  Nevertheless, she refused to flinch.
</p>

<p>
'I do not like riddles,' she declared.  'Perhaps
you had better think over more definitely what
you want to say to me, before Friday night, or
send a note up to my room.'
</p>

<p>
'There is no necessity,' he replied.  'What
I have to say to you is already quite clear
in my mind.'
</p>

<p>
He moved still nearer, stood over the couch
by her side.  Then the outside bell rang.  He
paused to listen.  Her heart gave a little jump
as a familiar voice asked for Mr. Kessner.
</p>

<p>
'It is Mr. Lavendale!' she exclaimed under
her breath.  'Don't let him find me here!'
</p>

<p>
His features relaxed.  He laughed and patted
her hand.  She could have said nothing to
inspire him with more confidence.
</p>

<p>
'Of course not,' he replied indulgently.  'Don't
be afraid.  George would tell him that I was
engaged.  He had my orders to let no one in.'
</p>

<p>
'But I heard him say that he would wait!'
she persisted anxiously.  'Cannot I hide
somewhere for a moment while you see him and
send him away?'
</p>

<p>
George made a discreet appearance.
</p>

<p>
'A gentleman inquiring for you, sir,' he
said.  'He is waiting outside in the corridor.
I told him that you would be a long time.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner considered for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Would you mind stepping into my sleeping
apartment?' he asked Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
She sprang up at once.
</p>

<p>
'You will get rid of him quickly?' she begged.
</p>

<p>
He pressed her hand affectionately.  She
endured his touch without flinching.  He handed
her over to George and pointed to the door of
his room.
</p>

<p>
'Give the young lady a chair inside,' he
ordered.  'I will see Mr. Lavendale.'
</p>

<p>
She was ushered into a bedroom and a moment
or two later she heard Lavendale announced.
Then George returned, handed her some American
papers and disappeared into the bathroom
beyond.  She rose to her feet as he closed
the door.  The sound of Lavendale's voice was
muffled and inaudible.  She glanced around
the room.  It was tastefully but very plainly
furnished.  There was nothing about on the
mantelpiece or bureau likely to be of the slightest
interest.  Suddenly her heart gave a little
jump.  George came out of the bathroom with
a coat upon his arm, threw open the bureau
and searched there for something.  As he
stood there, a thin, black silk pocket-book
slipped from the breast-pocket of the coat
and fell unnoticed on to the carpet.  A moment
later he closed the bureau, laid the coat
carefully out upon the bed and withdrew into
the bathroom, closing the door.  Suzanne held
her breath for a single moment.  Then she
stole across the floor, seized the pocket-book,
opened the bedroom door stealthily, and with
a little gulp of relief passed out into the corridor.
She ran up the stairs to her own room, gripping
the pocket-book in her hand.  Arrived there,
she locked the door, took up the telephone
and spoke to the hall-porter.
</p>

<p>
'Please don't let Mr. Lavendale go out,'
she directed.  'When he comes downstairs
send him up to my room&mdash;say that I wish
to see him at once.'
</p>

<p>
She slipped the pocket-book into the bosom
of her dress and waited.  In a few minutes
there was a ring at the bell.  Lavendale stood
outside.
</p>

<p>
'Come in at once,' she begged.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, but she dragged him in.
</p>

<p>
'Do not be foolish!' she exclaimed.  'Shut
the door.  You have just left Mr. Kessner?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he admitted.
</p>

<p>
'Why did you go there?'
</p>

<p>
'To see if you were getting yourself into
any trouble,' he answered grimly.
</p>

<p>
'You knew?'
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I knew!'
</p>

<p>
She drew the pocket-book from the bosom
of her gown.
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' she said, 'I am terrified.  I picked
this up from the bedroom.  It slipped out of
the pocket of his dinner-coat.  I haven't even
dared to look inside.'
</p>

<p>
He moved to the door and locked it, came
back and shook the contents out on to the
table.  There was a great roll of notes, some
visiting cards, some notes copied from a German
time-table, a long list of names, and a single
letter on thick, cream paper.  Suzanne stole
to the door on tiptoe and stood there, listening.
There was no sound in the corridor, no sound
in the apartment at all except a smothered
exclamation or two from Lavendale.  Presently
he called to her.  He was holding the papers
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne,' he whispered, 'listen.'
</p>

<p>
She caught him by the sleeve.  There was
a ponderous knocking at the door, the shrill
summons of the bell rang through the room.
Lavendale hesitated for a moment.  Then he
slipped the book into his inside pocket and
threw open the door.  Mr. Kessner's black
servant was standing outside.
</p>

<p>
'The master has sent his compliments,' he
said, 'and would be glad to know&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He glanced at Suzanne.  It was obvious that
Lavendale's presence in the room embarrassed
him.  Then he was suddenly pushed on one
side and back into the corridor.  Mr. Kessner
himself came quietly in and closed the door
behind him.  There was a queer little gleam
in his eyes, but his manner was unruffled.  He
tried the handle of the door to be sure that
it was closed.  Then he turned towards Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
'Will a million dollars,' he asked, 'buy me
back my pocket-book?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale drew it from his pocket and
promptly handed it across.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Mr. Kessner,' he remonstrated,
'you are surely not serious!  Miss de Freyne
was just explaining her little escapade to me
and I was coming in search of you.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner took no notice of either of them
for several moments.  He ran through the
contents of the pocket-book, then he slowly
thrust it into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
'I shall have the pleasure,' he said, 'on
Friday night?  You will not forget&mdash;the Ritz
at eight o'clock?'
</p>

<p>
'Charmed,' Lavendale murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Delighted,' Suzanne faltered.
</p>

<p>
He made a little bow&mdash;an ugly, awkward
bow&mdash;and left the room.  There was nothing in
his manner to indicate what his sensations were.
Lavendale and Suzanne looked at one another.
</p>

<p>
'Was there anything very important there?'
she asked.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing from your point of view, but
everything from mine,' he told her.  'There
was a list of forty-two names of German-Americans,
each giving a million dollars towards
a specific purpose.  There was a plan of a few
remaining estates in a certain part of Brazil,
still to be purchased to establish what at some
seasonable juncture should be declared to be a
German colony.  Some slight trouble with the
Government of Brazil, a German gunboat,
and behold!&mdash;German South America and to
Hell with the Monroe Doctrine!  A very
admirable scheme, only&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Only what?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't fancy that, thanks to you, those
estates will ever come into the market,' he
remarked dryly, 'not for a German purchaser,
at any rate.'
</p>

<p>
She glanced uneasily towards the door.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Lavendale,' she said earnestly 'I am
terrified!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I am afraid of Mr. Kessner,' she confessed.
'He took it much too quietly.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'A man of his temperament,' he said, 'seldom
wastes his time or his emotions.  He was
playing for a great stake which he knows now
that he will lose.  At the same time, he has
lost purely through accident.'
</p>

<p>
She suddenly smiled.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder,' she exclaimed, 'whether he
really expects us to dine with him at the Ritz
on Friday night!'
</p>

<p>
'We'll go and see, at any rate,' Lavendale
declared.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE MACHINATIONS OF MR. COURLANDER
</h3>

<p>
Lavendale glanced at his thin gold
watch and replaced it in his waistcoat
pocket.
</p>

<p>
'Three minutes past eight,' he remarked.
'Half a dozen pairs of gloves for me, I think.
Shall I go in and see about a table or would
you rather dine somewhere else?'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne made a little grimace.  They were
in the foyer of the Ritz Hotel, and she was
wearing a wonderful new gown.
</p>

<p>
'It is most disappointing,' she declared.  'I
had made up my mind to conquest.'
</p>

<p>
'I am very impressionable,' Lavendale assured
her.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head petulantly.
</p>

<p>
'It is not you whom I wish to subjugate.'
</p>

<p>
'I am too easy a victim, I suppose,' Lavendale
sighed.  'I am afraid that to-night, however,
you will have to be content with me.'
</p>

<p>
Her face suddenly changed, a brilliant smile
parted her lips, she glanced at him triumphantly.
Lavendale looked over his shoulder.  Mr. Kessner
was crossing the lounge towards them
with outstretched hand.
</p>

<p>
'You've lost your gloves,' Suzanne murmured
under her breath.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner greeted his two guests in the
most matter-of-fact fashion.
</p>

<p>
'I must apologize for being a few moments
late,' he said.  'It is rather crowded here
to-night, and I thought it best to go and see
that no mistake had been made about my
table.  I should like, if I may, to introduce
to you Mr. Courlander, a friend of mine from
New York.  Mr. Courlander is dining with us.'
</p>

<p>
The two young people murmured something
suitable.  Mr. Courlander turned out to be a
dark, heavy-browed man, clean-shaven, and
of a taciturn disposition.  The little party
made their way in to dinner.  They were ushered
to a small round table in the best quarter of
the room, a table lavishly arranged with flowers
and flanked with a couple of ice-pails, from
which gold-foiled bottles were protruding.
Suzanne gave a little sigh of content as she
sank into her chair, and looked around her
appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
'I have always observed,' she said softly,
'that the men of your country, Mr. Kessner,
know so well how to entertain.'
</p>

<p>
'And also,' Mr. Kessner remarked, blinking
slightly, 'how to select their guests.'
</p>

<p>
The service of dinner proceeded.  Mr. Kessner,
in his dress-suit, which seemed several sizes
too large for him, appeared somehow to have
become a more insignificant person than ever.
In this ultra-fashionable restaurant, full of
well-set-up men and soldiers in uniform, he
seemed almost like some by-product, something
not altogether human.  His very insignificance
compelled a certain amount of notice; conferred
upon him, perhaps, an air of distinctiveness
if not of distinction.  He was Kessner, the
multi-millionaire, probably over to secure
contracts from the Government.  The aroma of
wealth hovered around his table.  The term
'German-American' was unused&mdash;to few people
there did it convey any significance.  The
little party talked of every subject under the
sun except the war.  Mr. Courlander,
notwithstanding his heavy appearance, was an
excellent raconteur.  Dinner was more than
half-way through before their host changed
his attitude.
</p>

<p>
'You two young people did not, by any
chance, expect me to break my appointment
for this evening, did you?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'We had a bet about it,' Suzanne admitted.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me who wagered in my favour and I
will tell you which is the cleverer of the two?'
he offered.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne laughed.
</p>

<p>
'It was I who thought that you would come,'
she declared.
</p>

<p>
He bowed.
</p>

<p>
'After all,' he argued, 'why not?  Listen,'
he went on, leaning across the table.
'Courlander here does not count.  He is in my
confidence.  He was, indeed, at one time my
private secretary.  To the world I am an
American.  To our young friend here,' he went
on, indicating Lavendale, 'who appears to
have partly discarded his diplomatic career
for an excursion into the secret service of his
country, I am a German-American.  He follows
me to Germany.  He knows that I have a
conference with the Kaiser.  He is all agog
with the importance of it.  He comes back.
He consults with you, my dear young lady,
and with marvellous subtlety he asks me to
lunch and exposes me most unfairly to the trial
of your charms.  I succumb&mdash;what more natural?'
</p>

<p>
He leaned back in his chair while a portly
<i>maîtres d'hôtel</i> superintended the filling of their
glasses with champagne and explained to him
the mysteries of the course which was being
served.  Neither Suzanne nor Lavendale found it
easy to continue their meal unmoved.  Their
eyes were fixed upon this insignificant little man
who spoke with such deliberation, such a queer
little curl of the lips, such obvious enjoyment
of his own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'Your deep-laid scheme,' he went on, 'was
crowned with complete success.  The poor little
American was robbed of his secret.  By this
time it is probably known in Washington.
There is only one little fly in the ointment.
A private intimation has already been given
through our ambassador in Washington to
the American Government, that unless America
at once abandons her position of favouring
the Allies at the expense of Germany and
Austria, Germany will refuse now and for
always henceforth to respect and accept the
Monroe Doctrine.'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's breathless silence.
Then Lavendale drained his glass.
</p>

<p>
'You mean that that pronouncement has
already been made?' he murmured.
</p>

<p>
'It has already been made,' Mr. Kessner
assented.  'Further, you can understand quite
easily, I am sure, that the exact locality in
which this break should take place, although
interesting, is not of vital importance.  I do
not wish to dispirit you.  Yours was, without
doubt, an excellent stroke of work, and I,
the poor victim, am compelled to droop a
diminished head.  Yet I offer you this
explanation so that you can see the reason why I am
able to accept my defeat gracefully, to welcome
you both here as my guests, to raise my glass
to your beautiful eyes, mademoiselle, and to
wish you, Mr. Lavendale, the further success
in your profession which such subtlety and finesse
demand.'
</p>

<p>
'Say, he's eloquent to-night, isn't he?'
Mr. Courlander remarked.  'Quite an epic little
meeting, this.  I can assure you all that I
consider it an immense privilege to have been
asked to join your little party this evening.'
</p>

<p>
'My subtle friend,' Mr. Kessner continued,
setting his glass down empty, 'is now wondering
why you were asked to join it.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all,' Lavendale replied.  'The fame
of Mr. Courlander is well known to me.'
</p>

<p>
Their host for a single moment seemed
disturbed.  He recovered himself, however, almost
immediately.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Courlander,' he went on, 'as I have
told you was once my secretary.  Since then,
for a brief space of time, he became a
criminologist.  Disgusted with the coarse tendencies
of crime as practised in more modern cities
he abandoned that profession to become what
I might call a diplomatic detective.  He is the
terror of our loose-living public men and our
ambitious but dishonest politicians.'
</p>

<p>
'Our friend's career in America,' Lavendale
remarked dryly, 'must of necessity be a
strenuous one!'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner for a moment smiled.  There
was no effort of humour about the gesture.
It was simply a slow, sideways parting of the
lips, an index of thoughts travelling backwards
along a road lined with grotesque memories.
He drew a heavy gold pencil from his pocket
and signed the bill.  Then he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'We will take our coffee outside,' he suggested.
'Afterwards, if it meets with your approval,
I have a box at one of the music halls&mdash;I am
not sure which.'
</p>

<p>
They lingered only a few minutes over their
coffee.  While they sat there, however,
Mr. Kessner's secretary, a middle-aged man with
gold spectacles and abstracted manner, brought
in a note.  Mr. Kessner opened it, read it
carefully and tore it into small pieces.  He
rose, a few minutes later, joined his secretary,
who was waiting on the outskirts of the little
group, and walked with him twice down the
entrance hall.  Then he returned.
</p>

<p>
'The car is waiting,' he announced, 'if you
are ready.  Won't you, my Machiavellian young
friend,' he added, glancing at the scraps of
paper which he had left upon the coffee table,
'try and put those fragments together?  I
promise that you would find them interesting&mdash;more
intrigue, and a very interesting one,
I can assure you.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale found it hard to forgive himself
later for the impulse which prompted his
answer.  The temptation, however, was irresistible.
</p>

<p>
'I have no need to put them together to
know the source of your message,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
'No?' Mr. Kessner remarked politely, as
he lingered for a moment over adjusting Suzanne's
coat.  'There are a good many millions
of people in London, are there not?  Shall
I give you a hundred thousand to one against
naming the writer?'
</p>

<p>
'In dollars, if you like,' Lavendale replied
carelessly.  'I won't take your money, but I'll
start, then, with Baron Niko Komashi.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner, who had half turned away,
watching the result of his attentions to Suzanne,
became suddenly motionless.  His lips were a
little parted, he seemed almost paralysed.
When he turned slowly around there was a
new look in his eyes.  Courlander, on the other
hand, did not attempt to restrain an exclamation
of wonder.
</p>

<p>
'Baron Niko Komashi,' Kessner repeated.
'Who is he?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale laughed easily.  He was already
bitterly regretting his momentary lapse.
</p>

<p>
'Heaven knows!' he exclaimed.  'The odds
dazzled me.'
</p>

<p>
They walked out to the car almost in silence.
A new spirit seemed to have come to Kessner.
He looked and talked differently throughout
the rest of the evening's entertainment.  He
seemed somehow to have lost his air of half
bantering confidence.  When the time came
for farewells, he looked long and earnestly
into Lavendale's face.
</p>

<p>
'We must know one another better, young
man,' was all he said....
</p>

<p>
On their way back to her rooms, Suzanne
gripped Lavendale by the arm and asked him
a question.
</p>

<p>
'What does it all mean?' she demanded.
'Why did you guess Niko?  Why were they
both so thunderstruck?'
</p>

<p>
'Because,' he replied, 'Niko happened to
be the writer of that little epistle.'
</p>

<p>
Her large eyes gleamed at him through the
semi-darkness, filled with wonder.
</p>

<p>
'But how could you possibly know that?'
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
'It is your responsibility,' he explained.  'I
noticed the perfume directly he drew the note
from the envelope.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly&mdash;softly at first and then
heartily.
</p>

<p>
'Why, it is most amusing!' she exclaimed.
'He thinks you a necromancer.  He is, I believe,
a little afraid of you.  And that other man,
all through the performance he scarcely took
his eyes off you.'
</p>

<p>
'At any rate,' Lavendale observed, 'it has
given me something to think about.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Lavendale found his way to the American
Embassy early on the following morning, and
interviewed his friend Mr. Washburn.
</p>

<p>
'Anything from Washington?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I have only had a formal acknowledgment,'
Mr. Washburn replied, 'except that they added
a code word they don't often make use of, and
which I take to indicate a pat on the back for you.'
</p>

<p>
'Is it true,' Lavendale continued, dragging
a chair up to the side of Mr. Washburn's desk,
'that Berlin has given Washington to understand
that unless she changes her attitude toward
the Allies and withdraws her objection to
submarine warfare, she will no longer respect
the Monroe Doctrine?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Pourparlers</i> to that effect,' Mr. Washburn
confessed, 'have passed.  How did you come
to hear of them?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale smiled a little grimly, yet with
some self-satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
'I am getting on the track of something else
which promises to be even more interesting,'
he went on.  'Tell me, how do we stand with
Japan just now?'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Washburn knitted his brows.
</p>

<p>
'Still friction&mdash;always friction,' he admitted.
'The whole thing is too ridiculous.  Personally,
I consider our Western States are very much
to blame.  We have never before raised the
cry 'America for the Americans only,' and it's
too late to do it now.  And the fact of it is
you see, the Western States simply decline to
fall in with Washington Policy.  Then the
trouble comes.  Any particular reason for asking?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know yet,' Lavendale replied.
'There's a Japanese fellow named Komashi in
my line of business, seems to be very busy
just lately.  I only caught on to it last night,
though.  Chief well?'
</p>

<p>
'We are all overworked,' Washburn replied.
'We have had to send Barclay over to Berlin
to get a personal report about the prisoners'
camps there.  Then we get enough questions
from Germany ourselves, about their prisoners
here, to swamp the place.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale took up his hat.
</p>

<p>
'I'll see you later,' he promised.
</p>

<p>
He walked down the steps from Spring
Gardens into St. James's Park and sat for a
time upon a seat.  Exactly in front of him,
the upper floors of one of the big houses in
Carlton Terrace had been turned into a hospital,
and he could see the soldiers lying about in
long chairs, a few of them entertaining guests.
Behind him was the long row of huts built by
the Admiralty.  A troop of soldiers swung along
the broad road, a loudly playing band heralded
the approach of a little company of recruits.
Save for these things, London seemed as usual.
From where he sat, the hum and the roar
of the great city came as insistently as ever
to his ears.  His thoughts had travelled back to
New York.  How long, he wondered? ...
</p>

<p>
It was one of the chances of a lifetime which
brought Lavendale face to face that afternoon
with Baron Niko Komashi in a quiet street
near St. James's Square.  Niko would have
passed on without even a sign of recognition
but Lavendale stopped him.
</p>

<p>
'Good afternoon!' he said.
</p>

<p>
'Good afternoon!' the other replied gravely.
</p>

<p>
'I should like a few minutes' conversation
with you,' Lavendale proceeded.
</p>

<p>
Niko was perplexed but acquiescent.
</p>

<p>
'If it pleases,' he answered a little vaguely.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale marched him along the street.
</p>

<p>
'There is a little bridge club to which I
belong, close at hand,' he said.  'Come into the
sitting-room there for a few moments.  We shall
be quite alone at this hour of the afternoon.'
</p>

<p>
Niko suffered himself to be passively led
in the direction which his companion indicated.
In a few moments they were seated in the
comfortable parlour of a well-known bridge
club.  They were quite alone and Lavendale
closed the door.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he asked, 'how goes it with your new
ally?'
</p>

<p>
Niko's face betrayed nothing but mild wonder.
Lavendale smiled.
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' he said, 'I may be making a mistake
about you.  I do not think that I am.  I
think that you represent for your country what
I do for mine.  You are intensely patriotic.
So am I.  You realize the need for a certain
amount of diplomatic insight into the workings
of her constitution and her future.  So do I.
The only trouble is that you are for Japan and
I am for America.'
</p>

<p>
Niko assented very gravely.  His soft brown
eyes were watching Lavendale's lips as though
they would read upon them even the unuttered
words.  His finger-tips, soft and pliant as velvet,
were pressed together.
</p>

<p>
'You are not to be bought, my friend,'
Lavendale went on.  'Neither am I.  When
we walk together, you hedge yourself around
with restraint because you believe that I am
one of those who could bear your country ill-will.
That is where you are wrong.  That is where
there is a cloud between us which ought to
be driven away.  Japan and America naturally,
industrially and geographically, should be
friends, not enemies.'
</p>

<p>
'The causes of ill-feeling which lie between
us,' Niko observed suavely, 'are not of our
making.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor of ours&mdash;not of the true American,'
Lavendale answered promptly.  'It is the desire
of Washington, official Washington, that the
sons of your country who come to us should
be treated as our own sons.  What we have
to contend with, and you, is local feeling.
The only sentiment that exists against Japan
in my country is that local feeling, and the
people who have shown themselves most
virulently possessed of it are the compatriots of
the man who only within the last few weeks
has sought to pave the way for a disgraceful
compact with your country.'
</p>

<p>
Niko's face was a little whiter, his eyes were
filled with wonder.  Slowly he nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
'You surprise me with your knowledge of
things which I had imagined secret,' he said.
'Secret they have remained so far as I am
concerned.  Such information as you have
gained can have come but from one source,
so I will speak thus far.  The sword of Japan
shall be drawn in defence of her honour, and
for no other cause.  The alliance which you
suggest would be hateful and dishonouring to
my country.  Nor,' he concluded, 'would Japan
at any time commence a war with a treasonable ally.'
</p>

<p>
'What answer have you made to Kessner?'
Lavendale asked bluntly.
</p>

<p>
His companion gently raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
'Who is that gentleman&mdash;Mr. Kessner?' he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  I forgot,' he said.  'Those would not
be your methods.  Yet we know quite well
that the person whose name I have mentioned
has made overtures to you which could not,
under present circumstances, emanate from
Berlin.  Japan from the west, and Germany
on the east, might well embarrass a country
so criminally unprepared for war as mine.  I
take it, however, that that combination is not
to be feared.'
</p>

<p>
Niko rose from his place.  He had a habit
of ending a discussion exactly at the period
he chose.
</p>

<p>
'Not in your time or mine,' he answered
simply....
</p>

<p>
Lavendale, notwithstanding a nervous system
almost unexampled, was possessed of curiously
sensitive instincts.  Before he reached Pall
Mall, he was obsessed with an idea that he
was being followed.  He turned rather abruptly
around.  A tall, broad-shouldered man in dark
clothes, wearing a Homburg hat and with a
cigar in the corner of his mouth, waved his
stick in friendly greeting.
</p>

<p>
'This is Mr. Lavendale, isn't it?' he remarked.
'Kind of forgotten me, perhaps?  My name's
Courlander.  Met you with Mr. Kessner the
other night.'
</p>

<p>
'I remember you perfectly,' Lavendale
acknowledged.  'Very pleasant dinner we had.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courlander fell into step with his
companion, who had turned eastwards.
</p>

<p>
'There are few things in the world that
Ludwig Kessner doesn't understand,' he
continued, 'from the placing of a loan to the
ordering of a dinner.  He isn't much use at
eating it, poor fellow, but that's the fault of
his digestion.  Too much ice-water, I tell him.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale nodded affably.  He had no objection
whatever to discussing Mr. Kessner.
</p>

<p>
'Kind of misunderstood over here, the boss,'
Courlander went on.  'People think because
he's of German extraction that his sympathies
are altogether that way.  As a matter of fact, I
can tell you, Mr. Lavendale, that people are dead
wrong.  At the present moment&mdash;I wouldn't
have every one know this, but you're an
American, too&mdash;Mr. Kessner is making proposals
for a very large purchase of British War Loan.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he indeed!' Lavendale observed, in a
tone as colourless as he could make it.
</p>

<p>
Courlander glanced at him curiously.  They
were passing the Carlton and he drew his arm
through Lavendale's.
</p>

<p>
'Just one cocktail,' he suggested.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale hesitated for a moment, inspired
by an instinctive dislike of his companion.
Policy, however, intervened.  He accepted the
invitation and followed Courlander into the
smoke-room.  They found two easy-chairs and
the latter gave the order.
</p>

<p>
'I was talking about the boss,' he went on.
'There are others besides you who have
misunderstood him some, but they'll learn the
truth before the war's over.'
</p>

<p>
'When is Mr. Kessner returning to America?'
Lavendale asked.
</p>

<p>
'As soon as he can find a safe steamer,'
Courlander replied.  'He is a trifle nervous about
the Atlantic.  Say, that tastes good!'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courlander leaned back and sipped his
cocktail.  Lavendale, with a word of excuse,
rose to his feet and strolled across the room
to speak to an acquaintance.  He returned in
less than a minute.  Mr. Courlander was leaning
back in his chair, American from tip to toe.  He
wore a dark grey suit of some smooth material.
His square-toed boots, the little flag in his
buttonhole, his prim tie, his air of genial
confidence, were all eloquently and convincingly
typical of his nationality.  Lavendale was
followed by a waiter bearing two more glasses
upon a tray.
</p>

<p>
'Try my sort,' he invited.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courlander glanced at Lavendale's glass,
which was still three-quarters full.
</p>

<p>
'You haven't finished your first one yet,'
he remarked.
</p>

<p>
'A little too dry for me,' Lavendale replied,
placing it upon the tray and taking the full
glass.  'Here's luck!'
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at one another.  In
Courlander's hard brown eyes, a little narrowed
by his drooping eyebrows, there was an air of
fierce though latent questioning.  Then with
an abrupt gesture he took the glass from the
tray and drank off its contents.
</p>

<p>
'You'll forgive me if I hurry away,' Lavendale
went on.  'We shall meet again, I dare say,
before Mr. Kessner leaves.'
</p>

<p>
'Sure!' Mr. Courlander murmured, as he
picked up his hat.  'I am generally to be
found round about the Milan.  Like to have
you come and dine with me one night.'
</p>

<p>
The two men parted at the hotel entrance.
Lavendale got into a taxi and drove to his
rooms.  As he changed his clothes, he glanced
through his correspondence.  There was a
note from Suzanne which he read over
twice:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
'<i>Dear Friend,&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p class="quote">
'<i>I want to see you at once.  I shall be in
from seven till eight.  Please call.</i>'
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Lavendale glanced at the clock, hurried with
his toilet, and found himself ringing the bell
at the entrance door of Suzanne's suite at
half-past seven.  She admitted him herself and
ushered him into the little sitting-room, which
had been transformed almost into a bower
of deep red roses.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Kessner,' she exclaimed, pointing around,
'with a carte de visite!  You see what he
says?&mdash;'"From a forgiving enemy!"'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale glanced at them with a frown
upon his forehead.
</p>

<p>
'I'd like to throw them out of the window,'
he declared frankly.
</p>

<p>
'Do not be foolish,' she laughed.  'Listen.
You are dining somewhere?'
</p>

<p>
'At our own shop,' he replied.  'They ask
me about once in every two months, to fill up.'
</p>

<p>
'I wanted to speak to you about that man
Courlander,' she went on.
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Lawrence Dowell&mdash;the American newspapers
woman, you know&mdash;was in here yesterday and
stayed to lunch.  We saw Mr. Courlander in
the distance and she told me about him.  Do
you know that he was convicted of murder?&mdash;that
it was only through Mr. Kessner's influence
that he was taken out of Sing-Sing?  He was
a police-sergeant and his name was Drayton.
They say that there were several cases against
him of having men put out of the way who
had made themselves obnoxious to Tammany
Hall.  The sentence against him was quite
clear, yet Mr. Kessner not only managed to
have him released but made him his private
secretary.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale stood for a moment looking out
of the window with his hands in his pockets.
Then he turned slowly around.
</p>

<p>
'About an hour ago,' he said, 'this fellow
Courlander tried to doctor a cocktail I was
drinking in the Carlton smoking-room.'
</p>

<p>
'What?' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'I met him at the corner of St. James's Street,'
he went on.  'I had been in the club with
Niko Komashi, and I am perfectly certain that
he had been dogging me.  We walked along
Pall Mall and he pressed me to go in and have
a cocktail.  I happened to cross the room to
speak to Willoughby and on the way glanced
into the mirror.  I saw Courlander's hand
suddenly flash over my glass.  It was so quick
that even though I saw it myself, I could scarcely
believe it, and I'm certain that no one else
in the room could have noticed it.  When I
got back, I made some excuse and ordered
another cocktail.'
</p>

<p>
She seemed suddenly to lose some part of
that serenity which as yet he had never seen
even ruffled.  She was distinctly paler.
</p>

<p>
'You must be careful&mdash;please promise that
you will be careful,' she begged.
</p>

<p>
'This isn't New York,' he reminded her.
</p>

<p>
'But that man is a perfect devil,' she persisted
earnestly.  'He is a professional murderer.
He has no feeling, no mercy, and he is so
cunning.  And behind him there is Kessner and
all his millions.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'All the millions that were ever owned,'
he said, 'wouldn't help a man over here against
the law.  I am not afraid of Courlander.  There
is nothing he could try which I am not prepared
for, and if it comes to a hand-to-hand struggle,
I don't think I have anything to fear from him.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't like it,' she told him frankly.  'You
will be on your guard, won't you?'
</p>

<p>
His voice softened.
</p>

<p>
'Of course I will, but, Miss de
Freyne&mdash;Suzanne&mdash;why don't you like it?  Why do
you worry about me at all?'
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a moment.  She had turned
a little towards the window, her eyes had lost
their usual directness.  He took a step forward.
</p>

<p>
'It isn't because you care a little about me,
by any chance, is it?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand.  Then she turned
around and he saw that her eyes were soft
with tears.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne!' he faltered.
</p>

<p>
She turned towards him.  There was something
very sweet about her little gesture,
something yielding and yet restraining.
</p>

<p>
'Won't you please forget all this for just
a little time?' she pleaded.  'To tell you the
truth, I feel almost like a traitress when I even
let myself think of such things now that my
country is in such agony, when everything that
is dear to me in life seems imperilled.  You
have your work, too, and I have mine.  Perhaps
the end may be happy.'
</p>

<p>
He raised her fingers to his lips and kissed
them.
</p>

<p>
'I will obey,' he promised, turning towards
the door.
</p>

<p>
'And you will be careful&mdash;please be careful,'
she begged, as she let him out and squeezed
his arm for a moment.  'There!  Now you
must go to your dinner.  You look very nice,
and I am sure you will sit next some one
altogether charming, and perhaps you will forget.
But I shall like to think of this evening.' ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Practical, hard-headed, and with a sound
hold upon the every-day episodes of life,
Lavendale nevertheless passed through the
remainder of that evening with his head in the
clouds.  He was vaguely conscious of the other
twenty-three guests who shared with him the
hospitality of the Ambassador&mdash;a few diplomats,
a professor from Harvard University and his
wife, two other distinguished Americans, with
a sprinkling of their English connections.  He
sat next a distant relative of his own, an
American girl who had married an Englishman, and
his abstraction was perhaps ministered to by
the fact that conversation from him was entirely
unlooked for.  In the reception rooms afterwards
he found himself able to speak for a
moment with Washburn.
</p>

<p>
'Have you seen anything of Mr. Kessner?'
he asked.
</p>

<p>
The other made a little grimace.
</p>

<p>
'Very little,' he replied.  'The Chief and he
don't exactly hit it off.  I heard a rumour
the other day that he might be going back to
Germany.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale played a couple of rubbers of
bridge and was invited to take a cigar in the
library before he left.  It was shortly after one
o'clock before he stepped into the taxicab which
a servant had summoned for him.
</p>

<p>
'17 Sackville Street,' Lavendale directed.
</p>

<p>
He threw himself back in the corner of the
vehicle, and they glided off.  A drizzling rain
was falling and the streets were almost empty.
He leaned forward in his place to light a cigarette.
That fact and his habits of observation probably
saved his life.  He realized suddenly that this
was no ordinary taxicab in which he was
travelling.  It conformed to none of the usual
types.  The cushions were more luxurious, the
appointments unusual.  He sat for a moment
thinking.  The chauffeur was driving at a fair
pace, but he had taken a somewhat circuitous
route.  Lavendale tried the doors, first on
one side, then on the other.  They were both
fast, secured with some sort of spring lock.
Suddenly alert, he rose softly to his feet, crouched
for a moment upon the back seat and thrust
his head and shoulders through the window.
It was easy enough to wriggle out, to descend
and allow the vehicle to proceed to its
destination, wherever that might be, without its
passenger, but the love of adventure was upon
him.  He set his teeth, sank back once more
in his corner, half closed his eyes.  To all
appearance he might have been a tired
diner-out prematurely asleep.  As a matter of fact,
every nerve and sense was keenly on the alert,
and his right fingers were locked around the
butt of a small revolver.  Without protest or
comment, he saw himself conducted by a
roundabout way into a maze of quiet streets.
Then, with a little thrill of anticipation, he
saw a man who had been loitering near an
entry turn and follow the vehicle, which at
his coming had slackened speed.  The man
was wearing some sort of rubber-soled shoes
and his footsteps upon the street were noiseless.
Through his half-closed eyes, Lavendale was
nevertheless conscious of his approach, realized
his soft spring on to the footboard of the car,
was more than prepared for the sudden flick
in his face of a sodden towel, reeking with
chloroform.  His right fist shot out, the figure
on the footboard went reeling back into the
street.  Even then, prepared though he had
been, Lavendale for a moment gasped for breath.
The car, with a sudden grinding of the brakes,
came to a standstill.  They were at the top
of a darkly-lit street and not a soul was in
sight.  Lavendale thrust his foot through the
glass in front of him, shattering it all around
the driver.  The man half sprang to his feet,
but Lavendale's swift speech arrested him.
</p>

<p>
'Sit where you are,' he ordered.  'Never
mind about that other fellow.  Drive me to the
Milan Hotel.  You know the way, so do I.
If you go a yard out of it, feel this!'
</p>

<p>
He suddenly dug the muzzle of his revolver
into the man's neck.  The man, with an oath,
crouched forward.
</p>

<p>
'Do as I tell you,' Lavendale thundered, 'or
I'll shoot you where you sit!  Remember
you're not in New York.  Do as I tell you.'
</p>

<p>
Once more the car glided off.  They turned
almost immediately into Piccadilly, across
Leicester Square, passed up the Strand and drew
up at the Milan.  Lavendale put his head
through the window as the porter came out
from the Court entrance.
</p>

<p>
'I can't open this door,' he said.  'Ask
the fellow in front how to do it.'
</p>

<p>
The porter stared with surprise at the shattered
glass.  The driver slipped down, touched
a spring on the outside and the door flew
open.  He had pulled his cap deeper over his
face.  Lavendale looked at him for a moment
steadfastly.
</p>

<p>
'Wait for me,' he ordered.
</p>

<p>
He walked into the Court, rang for the lift
and ascended to the fourth floor.  He stepped
out and rang the bell at number seventy-four.
For a moment there was no answer.  He rang
it again.  Then a light suddenly flashed up
in the room and Mr. Kessner, fully dressed,
stood upon the threshold.  He gazed, speechless,
at Lavendale, who pushed forward across the
threshold, holding the door open with one hand.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Kessner,' he said, 'your thug with the
chloroform is lying on his back somewhere
near Sackville Street.  I shouldn't wonder if
his spine wasn't broken.  Your sham chauffeur
is downstairs with his sham taxicab.  I made
him bring me here.  You understand?'
</p>

<p>
The tip of Mr. Kessner's tongue had moistened
his lips.  His lined yellow face seemed more
than ever like the face of some noxious animal.
</p>

<p>
'You are drunk, young man,' he said.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale raised his arm and Mr. Kessner
stepped back.
</p>

<p>
'Don't be afraid,' Lavendale went on
scornfully.  'I am not going to shoot you.  When
the day of reckoning comes between you and
me, if ever it does, I shall take you by the
throat and wring the life out of your body.
But I am here now to tell you this.  Before I
sleep, a full account of this night's adventure,
instigated by you and your assassin Courlander,
will be written down and deposited in a safe
place.  If anything happens to me, if I disappear
even for a dozen hours, that paper will be
opened.  You may get me, even now, you and
Courlander between you, only you'll have to
pay the price.  See?  In England it's a damned
ugly price!'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner sucked the breath in between
his teeth.  Then, as though with some
super-human effort, he recovered himself.
</p>

<p>
'Say, young fellow, won't you come in and
talk this out?' he invited.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale laughed dryly.
</p>

<p>
'"Won't you walk into my parlour?"'
he quoted mockingly.  'No, thank you,
Mr. Kessner!  You know where we stand now.
Let me give you a word of warning.  London
isn't New York.  A very little of this sort of
thing and you'll find the hand of a law that
can't be bought or bribed or evaded in any
way, tapping upon your shoulders.  You understand?'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kessner yawned.
</p>

<p>
'You are a foolish young man,' he said, 'and
you've been reading a little too much modern
fiction.'
</p>

<p>
He slammed the door and Lavendale descended
to the street.  The courtyard was empty.
</p>

<p>
'The car didn't wait for me, I suppose?'
he inquired of the porter.
</p>

<p>
'The fellow drove off directly you went
upstairs, sir.  I shouted after him but he took
no notice.  Shall I get you a taxi, sir?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale fumbled in his pocket, found a
cigarette and lit it.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you,' he replied, 'I think I'll walk.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
THE INDISCREET TRAVELLER
</h3>

<p>
Lavendale walked slowly down the sunny
side of Pall Mall.  It was early in August,
and for the first time he seemed to notice some
reflection in the faces of the passers-by of the
burden under which the country was groaning.
The usual fashionable little throng about the
entrance to the Carlton, was represented by a
few sombrely-dressed women and one or two
wounded warriors.  The glances of the passers-by
towards the contents bill of the evening
papers had in them a certain furtive eagerness,
the fear of evil news triumphing now over the
sanguine optimism of earlier days.  It was
just at that tragical epoch when Russia, to
the amazement of the whole world, was being
swept back from her frontier cities, when there
were murmurs of an investment of Petrograd.
Lavendale, in his light grey suit and straw
hat, sunburnt, over six feet tall, broad and
athletic, seemed somehow a strange figure as
he passed along through streets which appeared
destitute of a single man under middle-age
who was not in khaki.  The recruiting sergeant
at the corner of Trafalgar Square, where
Lavendale paused for a moment to cross the road,
caught his eye and smiled insinuatingly.
</p>

<p>
'Fine figure for a uniform, sir,' he ventured.
</p>

<p>
'I am an alien,' Lavendale replied, watching
a troop of recruits pass by.
</p>

<p>
'American, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'That's so,' Lavendale admitted.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant looked him up and down and
sighed.
</p>

<p>
'America's a country, begging your pardon,
sir, that don't seem to have much stomach
for fighting,' he remarked, as the young man
passed on.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale crossed the street with a slight
frown upon his forehead.  He made his way
to the War Office and found Captain Merrill
in his room alone.  The two men exchanged
the greetings of intimate friends.
</p>

<p>
'Say, Reggie,' Lavendale began, 'you folks
are getting kind of nervy, aren't you?  A
recruiting sergeant in Trafalgar Square has just
gently intimated to me that I belong to a country
which has no stomach for fighting.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill grinned as he tossed his cigarette case
over.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he remarked, 'you don't seem to
be exactly spoiling for the fray, do you?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' he said, 'it's all very well for
you fellows to talk.  You've got the war fever
in your blood.  You're in it deep yourselves
and there's a sort of gloomy satisfaction in
seeing every one else in the same box.  The
chap who goes out to provoke a fight is worse,
of course, but the one who springs up and
reaches for his gun at the first chance of joining
in, is playing his game, isn't he?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you are right,' Merrill admitted.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not telling you or any one else exactly
what my opinion is about America's policy,'
Lavendale continued.  'I'll only remind you
that, even when those truculent forefathers of
ours went out to fight, they stopped to put
on their armour.  Is there anything fresh?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' was the somewhat doubtful
reply.  'There is a queer sort of feeling of
apprehension everywhere this morning.  The
Chief's been round to see the Prime Minister
and on to the Admiralty.  There's a rumour
that he went round to Buckingham Palace,
too.  Looks as though there were something
up.'
</p>

<p>
'You know all about it, I suppose,' Lavendale
remarked quietly.
</p>

<p>
'Not a thing!'
</p>

<p>
The young American knocked the ash from
his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
'The history of this war,' he went on, 'will
make mighty interesting reading, but there's
another history, a history that will never be
written, the history of the unrecorded things.
Gee, that would make people gossip if they
could get hold of only a few chapters of it!
You know there's something strange afoot,
Reggie.  So do I, though we sit here lying to
one another.  I doubt whether the man in the
street will ever know.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill selected another cigarette.
</p>

<p>
'I don't see where you come in here, Ambrose.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither do I,' the other agreed.  'Still,
the truth comes to light in strange ways
sometimes.  Last night I had a cable from a friend
in Petrograd, advising me to buy all Russian
securities.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'If there is to be any change for the better
in the valuations of Russian stock,' Lavendale
continued slowly, 'that is to say any immediate
change, it can only mean one thing.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill struggled hard to preserve his
expression of polite vacuity.
</p>

<p>
'There are very few people,' he murmured,
'who really understand Russia.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'It isn't exactly my show, you know!'
</p>

<p>
'It ought to be,' Merrill retorted curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Just common-sense.  If we don't win in
this war, it will be your turn next.  Japan
and Germany you'll have to face&mdash;you can
take my word for that&mdash;and I hope you'll like
it.  If we lose our Fleet, it's good-bye to
American independence.'
</p>

<p>
'Plain and simple words, young fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'Not so plain or so simple as they are true.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale threw away his cigarette and
stretched out his hand for his hat.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he said, 'I used to flatter myself
that I was an out-and-out neutral, but I'm
beginning to fancy that my sympathies are
leaning a little towards your side of the show.
Anyhow, I've no reason to keep secret the
little I know about this affair&mdash;in fact I
came down here to tell you.  New York was
talking openly last night of peace being
proclaimed between Germany and Russia within a
week.'
</p>

<p>
'We've tried her sorely,' Merrill confessed
doggedly, 'but I don't believe it.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'I tell you, Merrill,' he said, 'if you'd been
about town as much as I have for the last
twenty-four hours, you'd begin to wonder
yourself whether something wasn't amiss.
These rumours and feelings of depression are
one of the strangest features of the war, but
there it is at the present moment, in the streets
and the clubs and the restaurants&mdash;wherever
you turn.  I've noticed nothing like it since
the beginning of the war.  The optimists are
still cackling away, but it's there all the
same&mdash;a grim, disheartening fear.  One man told me
last night that he knew for a fact that Russia
was on the point of suing for peace.'
</p>

<p>
Merrill shook his head as he resumed his
place at his desk.
</p>

<p>
'It's just a phase,' he declared.  'Look in
and see me again, Ambrose, when you're feeling
a little more cheerful.' ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lavendale made a call in the Strand and
passed along that crowded, illuminative
thoroughfare towards the Milan.  Everywhere the
faces of the passers-by seemed indicative of some
new apprehension.  He bought an early paper,
but there was no word in it of any change in
the situation.  On any printed presentation
of the rumours which were on every one's
tongue, the censor had set his foot.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale called in at the bar at the Milan
for a few minutes.  The same feeling was there
even more in evidence.
</p>

<p>
'What's it all mean?' he asked an American
pressman whom he knew slightly.
</p>

<p>
The newspaper man nodded sagely.
</p>

<p>
'Guess the cat's out of the bag now,' he
opined.  'Russia has asked for peace and she
is going to have it on generous terms.  They
say that negotiations are going on right here,
under the Britisher's very nose.  Things'll be
pretty lively here soon.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale took his place in the luncheon-room,
a few minutes later.  As usual he glanced
expectantly towards the corner which Suzanne
de Freyne frequently occupied.  There were
no signs of her to-day, however.  He gave his
order and leaned back in his place.  Then
some fancy impelled him to glance towards
the glass entrance doors on his left.  He
sprang at once to his feet.  Suzanne, her face
whiter than ever, a queer, furtive gleam in
her dark eyes, was looking eagerly into the
room.  She saw him almost at the same moment
and hurried in.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne!' he exclaimed.  'What luck!
You are going to lunch with me, of course?'
</p>

<p>
A <i>maître d'hôtel</i> was holding the vacant
chair at his table.  With a little sigh she relapsed
into it.  She was plainly dressed and had the
appearance of having newly arrived from a
journey.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose I had better have something to
eat,' she sighed.  'Order something&mdash;anything,'
she added, brushing the carte away.  'It was
you I came to see.'
</p>

<p>
He recognized at once the fact that she was
in no humour for trivialities.  He gave a brief
order to the waiters, waved them away and
leaned towards her.
</p>

<p>
'You can command me,' he assured her.
'My time is yours.'
</p>

<p>
She drew a little sigh of relief.  For a moment
her little white fingers rested upon his strong
brown hand, the tenseness passed from her
manner, it was as though she found something
composing in his strength.
</p>

<p>
'I have been travelling for forty-eight hours,'
she said, speaking under her breath, 'and I had
an escape, a very narrow escape, in Belgium.
You do not want to understand everything, do you?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more than you choose,' he replied.
'I am your Man Friday.'
</p>

<p>
'Listen, then.  Your car&mdash;it is in order?'
</p>

<p>
'Perfect.  I came up from Bath the day
before yesterday&mdash;sixty miles on the level and
never changed speeds.'
</p>

<p>
'How long would it take you to get me down
to the east coast?' she asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'What part?'
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.
</p>

<p>
'A small place called Blakeney, between
Sheringham and Wells.'
</p>

<p>
He figured it out.
</p>

<p>
'Let me see,' he said,&mdash;'two hours to
Newmarket, two more to Fakenham, saving a little
on both runs if we escaped a puncture&mdash;say
four hours and a half, Suzanne.'
</p>

<p>
'And your car?'
</p>

<p>
'In the garage, five minutes away in a taxicab.'
</p>

<p>
She breathed another sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
'Now I shall eat some luncheon,' she declared.
'You will not mind if we commit ourselves to
rather a wild-goose adventure?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall enjoy it immensely,' he assured her,
'if one can use such a word at all these days.'
</p>

<p>
He ordered some wine and watched the colour
come back to her cheeks.  Towards the end
of the meal, however, she glanced often at the
clock.  He read her thoughts, signed his bill
and stood up.
</p>

<p>
'I am going upstairs to my room for a moment,'
she said briskly.  'Will you have a taxicab
waiting?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course!'
</p>

<p>
She was gone barely ten minutes.  When
she came down she carried a small travelling
case and wore a thick veil.  He hurried her into
the taxi, drove to the garage, and in less than
half-an-hour London lay behind them, and
the car was gathering speed at every moment.
They passed through Finchley and Potter's
Bar, slowed up through St. Albans, and settled
down at racing speed, northwards.  Suzanne
opened her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I am having a delicious rest,' she murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Where would you like some tea?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Not yet.  Push on as far as you can,' she
begged.  'What time shall we reach Fakenham?'
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the clock on the splashboard.
</p>

<p>
'If you really like to run right through,'
he said, 'you shall be there by six o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
She patted the hand which gripped the
steering wheel.
</p>

<p>
'You dear person!' she exclaimed softly.
'Now I close my eyes again.  I think I will
sleep a little.  Until I reached my rooms at
twelve o'clock to-day I had not had my clothes
off for two days.  This air and the rest are
wonderful.'
</p>

<p>
She settled back in her place and he touched
the accelerator with his foot.  Through
Stevenage and Baldock, across the great open spaces
to Royston, at sixty miles an hour to Newmarket,
up the hill, along the Norwich road, then round
to the left to Brandon, across the miles of
heath with the stunted pine trees and miles of
heather, into the more luxurious pastoral country
of eastern Norfolk.  It was half-past five when
they crossed Fakenham Common and crept
through the narrow streets of the old-fashioned
town.  He turned to look at her.  She was
still sleeping.  She woke, however, as the car
slackened speed.
</p>

<p>
'Where are we?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Fakenham,' he told her, 'with half-an-hour
to spare.  It's just half-past five.'
</p>

<p>
'You wonderful person,' she sighed, shaking
herself free from the rugs.
</p>

<p>
They drew up in the archway 01 the hotel
and made their way up the outside stairs
into the old-fashioned coffee-room.  She drank
tea and toyed with her bread and butter
absently.  She looked continually out of the
window, seawards.
</p>

<p>
'It is a wonderful day,' she said thoughtfully.
'There is no wind at all.  They might
come even before the time.'
</p>

<p>
He made her light a cigarette, followed her
example, and in a few minutes they were again
in the car.  Half-an-hour later they looked
down upon the quaint, old-world village of
Blakeney, set amidst the marshlands, and
beyond, the open sea.  Suzanne was all alertness
now and sat up by his side, gazing eagerly
towards the line of white breakers.  Suddenly,
with a warning hoot, a long, grey car which
had come up noiselessly behind them, swept
past at a great speed.  Suzanne gave a little
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
'It is the car, I am sure!' she declared.
'It has come to meet him!  All that I was told
is true.'
</p>

<p>
'It's some car, all right,' Lavendale remarked,
'but I wouldn't have taken his dust as quietly
as this if I'd heard him coming.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed at him.
</p>

<p>
'That car,' she said, 'is bound on the same
errand that we are.  It is on its way to Blakeney
to meet the same passenger.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, we're in time, anyway,' was his
only comment.
</p>

<p>
They slackened speed as they turned into
the long, narrow street.  About half-way down,
the car in front of them was stopped by a
soldier with drawn bayonet.  A non-commissioned
officer by the side was talking to the
driver.  Close at hand, a man in civilian
clothes was lounging in front of what seemed
to be the guardroom.  Suzanne clutched her
companion's arm in excitement.
</p>

<p>
'Ambrose!' she exclaimed.  'That's Major
Elwell&mdash;the man in mufti, I mean!  He is
one of the chiefs of the English Secret Service.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall have to know a little more about
this before I can catch on,' Lavendale confessed.
</p>

<p>
He brought his car slowly up behind the
other one.  The driver had raised his goggles
and was seated in an impassive attitude whilst
his license was being examined.  Presently
the little green book was returned to him
and he moved slowly down the village street.
Lavendale's license was inspected in the same
fashion, after which they, too, followed down
the village street, which terminated abruptly
in a small dock, reached by an arm of the sea.
Lavendale turned his car into the gateway
of the inn, and together, a few moments later,
they strolled down to the harbour.  Only a
thin stream of water covered the bottom of
the estuary, scarcely enough to float a rowing
boat, and one or two sailing barques were
lying high and dry upon the mud.  The stranger,
who had drawn up his car by the side of the
wall, was standing looking out seaward through
a pair of field-glasses.  Lavendale gazed across
the marshes in the same direction, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
'Say, you don't expect any ship that could
cross the North Sea to come into dock here,
do you?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Quite a large ship could come up at high
tide,' she explained, 'but to-night they will
not wait for the deep water.  They will anchor
outside and sail up in a smaller boat.  Come for
a walk a little way.  That man is watching us.'
</p>

<p>
They strolled along a sandy lane, through a
gate on the left opening on to the marshes.
It was a grey and sombre evening, strangely
still, colourless alike on sea and land and sky.
A thin handful of cattle was stretched across
the dyke-riven plain, a crowd of seagulls flapped
their wings wearily overhead.  Everywhere else
an intense and almost mournful silence prevailed.
Suzanne climbed to the top of one of the dykes
and looked intently seaward.
</p>

<p>
'You see!' she exclaimed, pointing.
</p>

<p>
A small boat was anchored at the opening
of the estuary.  Beyond, almost on the horizon,
was a thin line of smoke.
</p>

<p>
'They will not wait for the tide,' she told
him, 'not the full tide, that is.  They will
come up as soon as that sailing boat can make
the passage.'
</p>

<p>
'And who,' Lavendale inquired, 'will be
the passenger?'
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'He will be the man,' she said solemnly,
'who seeks to destroy France.' ...
</p>

<p>
They wandered a little way further out into
the marshland.  The air seemed to possess a
peculiar saltiness&mdash;even in that slightly moving
breeze they could feel the brackish taste upon
their lips.  They watched the tidal way grow
deeper every minute.  On either side of them
the narrow dykes and curving waterways grew
fuller and fuller with the tendrils of the sea.
About a mile from the distant coast-line the
steamer seemed to have come to an anchor,
and the white-sailed boat was fluttering about
her.  Suzanne took Lavendale's arm.  He could
feel that she was trembling.
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' he begged, 'tell me a little more
of what is going to happen?'
</p>

<p>
'Somebody will be landed from that steamer,'
she said.  'They will come up here, get into
the motor-car and start for London.  That
some one will be empowered to put certain
propositions before the Russian Ambassador
here, which he in his turn can convey to the
Tsar in code.  Those propositions will be for
a peace which will exclude my country and
yours, which will give Russia, temporarily
defeated, the terms of a conquering nation.'
</p>

<p>
He laughed a little contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
'You don't need to worry, child,' he assured
her.  'Russia isn't going to cave in yet awhile.'
</p>

<p>
'Not in any ordinary fashion,' she replied,
'but one lives in dread of some terrible disaster,
and then&mdash;&mdash;  These terms, they say, are to be
left over for a month.  Think of the temptation&mdash;all
the fruits of victory offered in the very
blackest moment of despair.  Look!'
</p>

<p>
She pointed to the mouth of the river.  The
white-sailed boat was already commencing the
passage of the estuary.
</p>

<p>
'Come,' she exclaimed, 'we must get back.'
</p>

<p>
They hurried across the marsh, finding their
way with more difficulty now owing to the
inward sweep of the tide, filling the narrow
places with the soft swirl of salt-water.  When
they reached the raised path by the side of the
estuary, the sailing boat was almost by their
side.  A man was seated in the stern, muffled
up in an overcoat and wearing a tweed cap.
</p>

<p>
'There he is,' she murmured.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale glanced at the man in a puzzled
fashion.  Just at that moment the latter turned
his head.  He was dark, clean-shaven, and
slightly built.
</p>

<p>
'Something rather familiar about him,'
Lavendale muttered.  'You don't know his name?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'Wait,' she begged.
</p>

<p>
They reached the dock just as the boat was
drawing up to the quay-side.
</p>

<p>
'Get out the car, please,' Suzanne directed,
'and drive slowly up the street, just past the
guardroom.  Wait there as though we had
been stopped again.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale obeyed.  This time, as they drew
up, Major Elwell leaned over the front of the car.
</p>

<p>
'He is here, I understand, Miss de Freyne,'
he said softly.  'Are you going to stay?
There may be a little trouble.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed derisively.
</p>

<p>
'This is Mr. Lavendale,' she whispered.  'He
will take care of me, Major Elwell.'
</p>

<p>
The latter looked keenly at Lavendale and
nodded.
</p>

<p>
'It's a queer piece of business, this,' he
observed.  'Maybe our information is all wrong,
after all.'
</p>

<p>
The other car came gliding up the village
street and was brought to a standstill only a
foot behind them.  The driver addressed the
sergeant almost angrily.
</p>

<p>
'I showed you my license a few minutes
ago,' he protested.  'What's that other car
doing ahead, blocking up the way?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale drew slightly on one side.  A
soldier, with fixed bayonet, slipped into the
little space between the two cars.  Major
Elwell turned towards the passenger.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to trouble you, sir,' he said, 'but
I must ask you to step inside the guardroom
for a moment.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you want with me?' was the quick
reply.
</p>

<p>
'You've landed from a steamer here, rather
an exceptional thing to do anyway,' Major
Elwell explained.  'There are just a few
questions we should like to ask.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm an American citizen,' the other declared.
'I have my passport here.  I can land where
I choose.'
</p>

<p>
'In ordinary times, without a doubt,' the
Major replied smoothly.  'Just now, I am
sorry to be troublesome, but there are some
new enactments which have to be considered.
We shall have to ask you to give up anything
you may have in the way of correspondence,
for instance, to be censored.'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  The face
of the man in the car had suddenly become
tense.  Lavendale, who had been looking around,
gave a little start.
</p>

<p>
'Why, it's Johnson!' he exclaimed&mdash;'Leonard
Johnson!  You remember me, don't you&mdash;Lavendale?'
</p>

<p>
The man in the car nodded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'Of course!' he assented.  'Look here, if
you've any pull in these parts, I wish you'd
persuade this officious gentleman to let me
go on quickly.  I'm in a hurry to reach London.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm afraid I can't,' Lavendale regretted.
'I'm hung up myself for some piffling reason.
Where have you come from?'
</p>

<p>
'Holland,' was the brief reply.
</p>

<p>
'If you are really in a hurry, sir,' Major
Elwell intervened politely,' you are only
wasting time by this discussion with your friend.
Before you proceed, you will have to come
into the guardroom with me.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm damned if I do!' Mr. Johnson replied.
'If you lay hands on me, I'll report the whole
affair at the Embassy directly I arrive in
London.  I'm well enough known there, and
they'll tell you that I am in the American
Embassy at Berlin.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shook his head gently.
</p>

<p>
'Not at the present moment, I think, Johnson,'
he remarked.  'I'll answer for it, though,
that you are a reputable American citizen.'
</p>

<p>
'My instructions are entirely independent
of your nationality,' Major Elwell said firmly.
'I must trouble you to descend at once.'
</p>

<p>
There was scarcely a whisper, scarcely even
a glance between the two men in the hindmost
car.  Action seemed to be entirely spontaneous.
Their car, which had moved perhaps a foot or
so back while they were talking, as though the
brakes had failed to hold, was suddenly swung
to the right.  The front wing caught the soldier
who was standing on guard, and the car,
plunging forward with one wheel upon the
pavement, threw him off his balance.  He
reeled back against the wall, and almost before
they could realize what had happened, the car
was tearing up the hill.  The sergeant snatched
a rifle from one of the men but Major Elwell
stretched out his hand.
</p>

<p>
'We don't want that!' he exclaimed.  'Telephone
at once to all the places en route to
London, car number LC 3221.  Can you make
any sort of speed, Mr. Lavendale?'
</p>

<p>
'Jump in,' was the grim reply.  'You'll
soon see.'
</p>

<p>
They dashed up the hill, travelling almost
at the same speed as the other car.  As they
passed the church they saw it a speck in the
distance, climbing the next hill.  Lavendale
slipped in his fourth speed.
</p>

<p>
'Thank God for the dust!' he muttered.
'We shall see which way they go.  Hold on,
Suzanne.  We'll have to take risks.'
</p>

<p>
The air rushed past them.  The finger of
the spedometer crept up from thirty to fifty
and sixty miles an hour.  They swung round the
corner, and through a tiny village, a cloud of
dust rising behind, heedless of the curses
shouted after them by the irate foot passengers.
</p>

<p>
'He's gone to the right,' Lavendale announced.
'That's Letheringsett.  He'll leave the London
road, though, if he can.'
</p>

<p>
'He'll try to give you the slip,' Major Elwell
remarked, 'and take the train from somewhere.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale smiled.  The finger in front of
them was still creeping upwards.  They missed
a hay wagon by a few inches.  The pillar of
dust in front of them grew nearer.
</p>

<p>
'We'll shepherd him into Fakenham,' Lavendale
muttered.  'I could catch him now, if
I wanted.  They'll have had the message there,
though.'
</p>

<p>
They skirted Letheringsett, up the hill, round
corner after corner, through Thursford, with
barely a hundred yards dividing them.  Once,
at some cross-roads, the car in front seemed
to hesitate and they shot up to within fifty
yards.  The light now was becoming bad.
There were little patches of shadow where the
trees overhung the road.
</p>

<p>
'They're giving it up!' Lavendale exclaimed.
'By Jove, we've got them!'
</p>

<p>
He pointed forward.  The road running into
Fakenham narrowed.  A line of three soldiers
stood across the thoroughfare.  With a grinding
of brakes and ponderous swaying of the foremost
car, the chase was over.  Mr. Leonard Johnson
descended, shaking the dust from his coat.
</p>

<p>
'Following me?' he asked Lavendale sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell's hand fell upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'We're not meaning to lose sight of you again
just yet, sir,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'You know what risk you run in interfering
with an American citizen?' the other demanded.
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly,' Major Elwell replied.
</p>

<p>
'You don't, that's certain, or you wouldn't
attempt it,' Johnson snapped.  'However, we
can't talk in the street.  I'll get into your car
and go on to the inn with you.'
</p>

<p>
They drove on to the Crown Inn, mounted
the outside staircase, Lavendale in front and
Major Elwell bringing up the rear.  The coffee-room
was empty.  They rang for refreshments
and dismissed the waiter.  Johnson threw back
his overcoat.
</p>

<p>
'Now, let's have this out,' he began
truculently, addressing Major Elwell.  'Who the
mischief are you, and what do you mean by
following me like this?'
</p>

<p>
'I am censor for the neighbourhood in which
you landed from Holland, Mr. Johnson,' was
the quiet reply.  'Your present position is
entirely the result of your own injudicious
behaviour.'
</p>

<p>
'What exactly do you want?' Johnson demanded.
</p>

<p>
'After your attempts to escape,' Major
Elwell announced, 'I shall be compelled to
search you.'
</p>

<p>
Johnson drew a revolver from his pocket.
His manner remained bellicose.
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' he said, 'if you're looking for
trouble you can have it.  I don't recognize
the right of anybody to interfere with my
movements.'
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell strolled slowly across the room
to where Johnson was standing, looking all
the time down the muzzle of the outstretched
revolver.
</p>

<p>
'One moment, Mr. Johnson,' he said.  'Do
you mind glancing out of this window?  No,
you can keep your weapon&mdash;I've no designs on
that.  Just look down into the street.'
</p>

<p>
Johnson did as he was bidden.  Half a dozen
soldiers were lined up outside the entrance.
</p>

<p>
'Then out of the door, if you please,' the
Major further suggested.
</p>

<p>
He held it open.  At the bottom of the stairs
a sentry was standing with drawn bayonet.
Johnson stared at him for a moment.  Then he
turned abruptly away.
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' he said hoarsely, 'this censor
business don't go with me.  You're lying!'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so,' Major Elwell admitted smoothly,
'and so are you.  You mentioned, I think,
that you had been in the American Embassy
at Berlin.  You omitted to mention, however,
that you have since joined the German Secret
Service.  As that fact is well-known to us,
you can understand, I dare say, why we regard
this landing of yours upon a lonely part of the
coast with some&mdash;shall I say suspicion?'
</p>

<p>
Johnson stood very still for a moment.  He
seemed to be thinking deeply.
</p>

<p>
'This censorship of yours is a bluff, I suppose,'
he muttered.
</p>

<p>
'Amongst many other positions,' Major Elwell
admitted, 'I also hold a somewhat important
place in the English Secret Service.  You have,
I trust, one of the first qualifications for useful
service in your profession&mdash;you are able to
recognize the inevitable?  You are face to
face with it now.'
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.  Johnson was
standing at the window with his hands behind
him.  Presently he turned around.
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' he pronounced curtly, 'you've
got me fairly enough.  Go ahead.'
</p>

<p>
'You see,' Major Elwell explained, 'you
might, under the present laws, be treated as
an ordinary indiscreet traveller&mdash;or as a spy.
Better hand over everything you are carrying.'
</p>

<p>
Johnson opened his coat pocket and threw
a few letters and a pocket-book upon the
table.  Major Elwell glanced them through and
sighed.  Then he turned towards Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
'If you would give us a couple of minutes,
please,' he begged.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale led her out into the yard.  In a
few minutes the door behind them was thrown
open.  The Major was standing at the top of
the steps.
</p>

<p>
'Where's the car?' he shouted&mdash;'the car
they came in?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale looked down the yard and dashed
into the street.
</p>

<p>
'Where's the other car?' he asked one of
the soldiers on guard.
</p>

<p>
'No instructions to detain it, sir,' the man
replied.  'The chauffeur drove it to the garage
to fill up with petrol.'
</p>

<p>
They ran across the street in a little procession.
The man in charge of the place stared at them,
a little dazed.
</p>

<p>
'Car came in about ten minutes ago&mdash;a
great Delauney-Belleville,' he informed them.
'She filled up and started off for London.'
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell turned towards Lavendale and
laughed hardly.
</p>

<p>
'That fellow's first job, he muttered, 'and
he's done us in!  The documents he was
carrying are in that car!'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell spent the next hour in the
telegraph office whilst Lavendale and Suzanne
raced southwards.  More than once they had
news of the car of which they were in pursuit.
At Brandon it was only twenty minutes ahead,
and at Newmarket they learnt that the driver
had called at the station, found there was no
train for an hour and continued his journey.
From Newmarket, through Six-Mile-Bottom
and onwards, they touched seventy miles an
hour, and even Suzanne shivered a little in
her seat.  At the Royston turn the sparks flew
upwards through the grey light as Lavendale's
brakes bit their way home.
</p>

<p>
'Two ways to London here,' he muttered.  'Wait.'
</p>

<p>
He took a little electric torch from his pocket
and stooped down in the road.  In less than
a dozen seconds he was back in the driving
seat.
</p>

<p>
'By Royston,' he whispered.  'I fancy,
somehow, we are gaining on him.'
</p>

<p>
They tore onwards along the narrow but
lonelier road.  Once, on a distant hillside far
in front, they caught the flash of a light.
Lavendale gave a little whoop of triumph.
</p>

<p>
'We shall get him,' he cried fiercely.  'We've
twenty miles of road like this to Royston.'
</p>

<p>
The excitement of the chase began to tell
on both of them.  Suzanne, sitting close to
the side of the car, leaned a little forward,
her eyes bright, her hair wind-tossed, her
cheeks flushed, breathless all the time with
the lashing of their speed-made wind.  Lavendale
sat like a figure of wood, leaning a little
over his wheel, his hands rigid, his whole frame
tense with the strain.  Once more they saw
the light, this time a little nearer.  Then they
skidded crossing an unexpected railway track,
took a few seconds to right themselves, and
the light shot ahead.  They passed through
Royston and shot up the hill, scarcely slackening
speed.  It was a little before moonlight now,
and the heath stretching away on their left
seemed like some silent and frozen sea on
which the mists rested lightly.  Suddenly a
little cry broke from Lavendale's lips, his foot
crushed down upon the brakes.  In front of
them, by the side of the road, was the other
car, disabled, its left wheel missing, the driving
seat empty.  They came to a standstill within
a few feet of it and Lavendale leapt lightly
out.  Lying with his head upon the grass was
the driver.  Lavendale bent rapidly over him.
</p>

<p>
'The front wheel must have shot off and
pitched him forward,' he explained to Suzanne.
'I'm afraid he is hurt.  You'd better go and
sit in the car.'
</p>

<p>
Then the woman he had seen nothing of
blazed out from the girl by his side.
</p>

<p>
'Do not be foolish,' she cried fiercely.  'He
is alive, is he not?  Quick!  Search him!'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale for a moment was staggered.
He was feeling for the man's heart.
</p>

<p>
'What is the life or death of such as he!'
she continued, almost savagely.  'Search him,
I say!'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale obeyed her, a little dazed.  There
was a license, a newspaper of that morning's
date, a few garage receipts for petrol, a
handkerchief, a penknife and a large cigarette
case&mdash;not another thing.  She pushed him on
one side while she felt his body carefully.  The
man opened his eyes, groaning.
</p>

<p>
'My leg!' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale stood up.
</p>

<p>
'I think that's all that's the matter with him,'
he pronounced&mdash;'fracture of the leg.  We'd
better take him back to the hospital.'
</p>

<p>
'Leave him alone,' she ordered.  'Come here
with me at once.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale obeyed mutely.  She sprang up
into the dismantled car and began feeling the
cushions.
</p>

<p>
'Look in the pockets,' she directed.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale turned them inside out.  There
were maps, a contour book, an automobile
handbook, more garage receipts, an odd
glove&mdash;nothing of interest.  Suddenly Suzanne gave
a little cry.  She bent closer over the driving
cushion, pulled at a little hidden tab, opened
it.  There reposed a letter in a thick white
envelope, the letter of their quest.  Lavendale
flashed his electric torch upon it.  It was
addressed in plain characters:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>To His Excellency.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He thrust it into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' he insisted, 'we've found what
we want.  We must see about that man now.'
</p>

<p>
They lifted him into their car and drove
him back to the hospital.  Lavendale left
money, called at the police-station and gave
information about the accident.  Then they
ran up to the hotel and stood side by side for
a moment in the dimly-lit, stuffy coffee-room.
He drew the letter from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the seal&mdash;huge and resplendent.
</p>

<p>
'It is only the first part of our task that
is done,' she sighed, 'yet everything is ready
for the second.  That letter will be delivered.
It is the answer we want.'
</p>

<p>
She took the letter and placed it in the small
bag she was carrying.
</p>

<p>
'Some sandwiches, please,' she begged, 'and
then London.'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Twenty-four hours later they sat in her little
sitting-room.  Suzanne was restless and kept
glancing at the clock, lighting cigarettes and
throwing them away.  Often she glanced at
Lavendale, imperturbable, a little troubled.
</p>

<p>
'Why do you frown?' she demanded.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' he answered simply.  'This
business has its dark side, you know.  I was
thinking of it from your point of view.  You
are going to open a friend's letter&mdash;that's
what it comes to.  You're on fire to see whether
your friend, whom you should trust, is as
honourable as you think him.  It leaves an
unpleasant flavour, you know.'
</p>

<p>
She came to a standstill before him.
</p>

<p>
'My friend,' she said, 'you have something
yet to learn in our profession.  It is
this&mdash;honour and joy, conduct itself, idealism, all
those things that make up the mesh of life,
lose their significance to the man or woman
who works for his country as I have done,
as you have commenced to do.  I am for
France alone, and for France's sake I have
no character.  For France's sake I have sent
a dummy messenger to the Prince.  For France's
sake I shall open the reply.  It may tell me
everything, it may tell me nothing, but one
must be warned.'
</p>

<p>
There was a ring at the bell.  A young man
entered, closing the door behind him.  Suzanne
almost sprang towards him.
</p>

<p>
'You have the answer?' she cried.
</p>

<p>
The messenger bowed.  Suzanne was suddenly
calm.  She tore open the long, thick
envelope with trembling fingers.  She peered
inside for a moment, doubtfully.  Then her
whole face relaxed, her eyes flashed with joy.
She held the envelope up over the table.  A
little stream of torn pieces of paper fell from
it.  Her eyes were moist as she watched them.
</p>

<p>
'It is the offer of our enemy,' she cried,
'and the answer of our ally!  Some scraps
of paper!'

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
THE UNDENIABLE FORCE
</h3>

<p>
Lavendale drew a deep sigh of content
as he withdrew his eyes reluctantly
from the glittering phantasmagoria of the city,
stretching away below like a fire-spangled carpet.
He leaned back in his chair and raised his
glass to his lips.
</p>

<p>
'No doubt about my being an American
born, Moreton,' he observed.  'The first night
in New York is always a real home-coming
to me.  And this is New York, isn't it?' he
went on, musingly, 'city of steel and iron,
typical, indescribable.'
</p>

<p>
Jim Moreton, an erstwhile college friend
and now a prosperous lawyer, nodded sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
'We are right in the heart of things here,'
he assented.  'Nothing like a roof garden
round about Broadway, to see us at home.
I wonder whether you noticed any change?'
he went on.  'They tell us that we get more
European every year in our love of pleasure
and luxury.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale glanced around at the many little
groups dining on the twenty-eighth storey of
a famous hotel, under the light of the big,
yellow moon.  The table illuminations, and
the row of electric lights which ran along the
parapet, seemed strangely insignificant.
Everywhere was a loud murmur of conversation,
punctuated by much feminine laughter, the
incessant popping of corks, the music of the
not too insistent band.
</p>

<p>
'I tell you, Jimmy,' he confided, leaning
forward towards his friend, 'to look into the
faces of these people is the greatest relief I have
known for twelve months.  Just at first, when
war broke out, one didn't notice much change,
in England especially, but latterly there has
been no mistaking it.  Wherever you went,
in the streets or the restaurants, you could
see the writing in the faces of the people, a
sort of dumb repression of feeling, just as
though they were trying to get through the
task of every-day life because they had to,
eating and drinking because they had to,
talking, amusing themselves, even, with an
absent feverishness all the time&mdash;unnatural.
I tell you it's like being in some sort of a dream
to be in London or Paris to-day.  It's only
to-night I've felt myself back amongst real
men and women again, and it's good.'
</p>

<p>
Moreton nodded understandingly.
</p>

<p>
'A fellow was writing something of the
sort in one of the Sunday papers last week,'
he remarked.  'Over here, of course, the whole
thing to us is simply pictorial.  We don't
realize or appreciate what is happening.  We
can't.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet some day,' Lavendale sighed,
'we shall have to go through it ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'One of your Harvard theories cropping up
again!'
</p>

<p>
'It's more than a theory now&mdash;it's a certainty,'
Lavendale insisted.  'One doesn't need to
brood, though.  There's plenty of real life
buzzing around us all the time.  Do you know
why I sent you that wireless, Jim?'
</p>

<p>
'Not an idea on earth,' the other admitted.
'I guess I was conceited enough to hope that
you wanted to see me again.'
</p>

<p>
'That's so, anyway,' Lavendale assured
him, 'and you know it, but apart from that
I want you to do something for me.  I want
to meet your uncle.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll do what I can,' Moreton promised, a
little dubiously.  'He isn't the easiest person
to get at, as you know.'
</p>

<p>
'Where is he now?' Lavendale inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I haven't had a line from him or my aunt
for months,' Moreton replied, 'but the papers
say he is coming to New York to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything in these sensational reports
about his new discovery?' Lavendale asked
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'I shouldn't be surprised,' the other confessed.
'There is no doubt that he is giving up his
laboratories and closing down in the country.
He told me himself, last time I saw him, that
the thing he'd been working at, off and on,
for the last thirty years, was in his hands at
last, perfect.  He's through with inventing&mdash;that's
how he put it to me.  He is going
to spend the rest of his days reading dime
novels in the mornings and visiting cinemas
in the afternoons&mdash;says his brain's tired.'
</p>

<p>
'I shouldn't wonder at that,' Lavendale
observed.  'He was seventy-two last year,
wasn't he?  I wonder how long he'll keep
his word, though.'
</p>

<p>
'He seems in earnest.  He has been very
cranky lately, and they were all terrified down
at Lakeside that he'd blow the whole place up.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't know any particulars about this
last invention, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'If I did,' Moreton declared with a little
laugh, 'I could have had my weight in dollars
from the newspaper men alone.  No, I know
nothing whatever about it.  All I can promise
is that I'll take you up to Riverside Drive
and do my best to boost you in.  Now tell
me what you've been doing with yourself
this year, Ambrose?  You've left the
Diplomatic Service, haven't you?'
</p>

<p>
'Not altogether.  I have a sort of unofficial
position at the Embassy, perhaps as important
as my last one, only not quite so prominent.'
</p>

<p>
'Still as great a scaremonger as ever?  Do
you remember those discussions you used to
start at the debating society?'
</p>

<p>
'I remember them all right,' Lavendale
assented grimly, 'and since you ask me the
question, let me tell you this, Jim.  I've lived,
as you know, during the last seven years in
the diplomatic atmosphere of Paris, of London
and Berlin.  I tell you soberly that anything
I felt and believed in those days, I feel and
believe twice as strongly to-day.  Just look
over your left shoulder, Jimmy.  Isn't that
rather a queer-looking couple for a fashionable
roof-garden!'
</p>

<p>
Moreton turned a little lazily around.  An
elderly man and woman who had just entered
were being shown to an adjacent table.  The
man was apparently of some seventy years
of age, his morning clothes were of old-fashioned
cut and he wore only a little wisp of black
tie.  His grey beard was cut in the fashion
of a century ago, his bushy hair was long and
unkempt.  His companion, who seemed but a
few years younger, wore the simplest of dark
travelling clothes, some jet jewellery, a huge
cameo brooch fastened a shawl at her throat
and she carried a leather handbag.
</p>

<p>
'Don't they look as though they'd come
out of the ark!' Lavendale murmured.
</p>

<p>
Moreton had risen slowly to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'Queer thing that you should spot them,
Ambrose,' he remarked.  'This is what you
might call something of a coincidence.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't mean to say that you know them?'
</p>

<p>
Jim Moreton nodded.
</p>

<p>
'My Uncle Ned and my Aunt Bessie,' he
said.  'I must go and speak to them.'
</p>

<p>
He crossed towards the elderly couple, shook
hands with the man, who greeted him cordially
enough, and submitted to an embrace from
the lady.  Lavendale could hear, every now
and then, scraps of their conversation.  Towards
its close, his friend turned and beckoned to
him.  Lavendale, who had been eagerly awaiting
a summons, rose at once and approached the trio.
</p>

<p>
'Aunt,' Moreton explained, laying his hand
upon his friend's shoulder, 'this is Mr. Ambrose
Lavendale, a graduate of my year at Harvard.
Uncle, Lavendale has just returned from Europe
and he was talking to me about you.  He is
like the rest of us, tremendously interested
in what all the world is saying about you and
your latest discovery.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shook hands with the elderly couple,
who greeted him kindly.
</p>

<p>
'Discovery, eh?' Mr. Moreton observed
jocularly.
</p>

<p>
'That does seem rather an inadequate word,'
Lavendale admitted.  'I think one of your
own newspapers here declared that you had
learnt how to bottle up the lightnings, to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, those damned papers!' Mr. Moreton
exclaimed irritably.  'Don't talk to me about
them, young fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'I would much rather talk to you about what
they are aiming at,' Lavendale said simply.
'Are you going to give any demonstration,
sir&mdash;I mean, of course, to the scientific world?'
</p>

<p>
The inventor glanced up at his questioner
with a little twinkle in his hard, blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Say, you've some nerve, young fellow!'
he declared amiably.  'However, I am very
fond of my nephew here, and if you're a friend
of Jim's you shall be one of a very select
company to-morrow morning.  The scientific
world can wait, but I am going to set the minds
of the newspaper people at rest.  I am going
to show them what I can do.  I was thinking
of asking you, any way, Jim,' he went on,
'and you can bring your friend with you.
Twelve o'clock at Riverside Drive.'
</p>

<p>
The two young men were both profuse in
their thanks.  Mr. Moreton waved them away.
'There will be just three or four newspaper
men,' he continued&mdash;'I put the names of the
principal papers into a bottle and drew lots;
the reporters who came down to Jersey State
agreed to that&mdash;you two, your aunt and a
young lady.  You can go and finish your
dinner now, boys.  Your aunt and I, Jim,
are going on to a cinema afterwards.  We're
going to make a real night of it.'
</p>

<p>
The two young men shook hands and made
their adieux.  As soon as they had resumed
their places, Lavendale leaned across the table
towards his friend with glowing face.
</p>

<p>
'Jimmy, you're a brick,' he declared.  'We'll
have another bottle on the strength of this.
The very night I arrive, too!  Whoever heard
of such luck!  I don't suppose I should ever
have got within a hundred yards of him but
for you.'
</p>

<p>
'He's a shy old bird,' Moreton admitted.
'We certainly were in luck to-night though.'
</p>

<p>
'I wonder who the girl is who's going to
be there,' Lavendale remarked idly.
</p>

<p>
His eyes had suddenly strayed once more
over the brilliant yet uneasy panorama of
flashing lights, huge buildings, the throbbing
and clanging of cars across the distant line
of the river to the blue spaces beyond.  The
leader of the little orchestra behind was playing
a familiar waltz.  Suzanne and he had danced
it together one night in London.  He was for
a moment oblivious of the whole gamut of
his surroundings.  The world closed in upon
him.  He heard her voice, felt the touch of
her fingers, saw a gleam of the tenderness which
sometimes flashed out from beneath the
suffering of her eyes.  His friend glanced at
him in wonder.  It was the insistent voice
of a waiter which brought him back from his
reverie.
</p>

<p>
'French or Turkish coffee, sir?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale made a heedless choice and climbed
down to the present.
</p>

<p>
'Way back somewhere, weren't you?' Jim
Moreton remarked.
</p>

<p>
His friend nodded.
</p>

<p>
'I have left behind a great deal that one
remembers.'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
At a few minutes before twelve on the
following morning, Lavendale and his friend
were conducted by a coloured butler across
a very magnificent entrance hall of black and
white marble, strewn with wonderful rugs,
through several suites of reception rooms, and
out on to a broad stone piazza, at the back of
Mr. Moreton's mansion in Riverside Drive.
It was here that Lavendale received one of
the surprises of his life.  Mr. and Mrs. Moreton
were reclining in low wicker chairs, and between
them, a miracle of daintiness in her white
linen costume and plain black hat, was&mdash;Suzanne.
Lavendale forget his manners, forgot the
tremendous interest of his visit, forgot everything
else in the world.  He stood quite still for a
moment.  Then he strode forward with
outstretched hands and a very visible gladness
in his face.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne!' he exclaimed.  'Why, how wonderful!'
</p>

<p>
She laughed at him gaily as she accepted
his greeting.  There was some response to
his joy shining out of her eyes, but it was
obvious that his presence was less of a surprise
to her.
</p>

<p>
'You did not know that I was here?' she
asked.  'But why not?  Men and women
have travelled many times round the world
before now to learn its secrets.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale recovered a little of his
self-possession.  He shook hands with
Mrs. Moreton, who was beaming placidly upon them,
mutely approving of this unexpected romance.
The great inventor turned him round by the
shoulder and indicated four men of varying
ages who formed the rest of the little company.
</p>

<p>
'I will not introduce you by name,' he
said, 'but these four gentlemen, selected by
lot, as I think I told you last night, represent
the mightiest and holiest power on earth&mdash;the
great, never-to-be-denied Press of America.
They are here because, since the first rumour
stole from my laboratory down in Jersey
State that I had reached the end of my labours,
I have been the victim of an incessant and
turbulent siege, carried on relentlessly day by
day&mdash;I might almost say hour by hour.  For
good reasons I desired to keep my discovery
to myself a little longer, but I know that I
am beaten, and these gentlemen, or rather
the power which they represent, have been
too many for me.  My country household
has been honeycombed with spies.  My medical
man, my gardener, the assistants in my
laboratory, have every one of them been made the
objects of subtle and repeated attempts at
bribery.  Young Mr. Lavendale, let me tell
you this&mdash;the Press of America to-day is the
one undeniable force.  Look at them&mdash;my
conquerors.  I am going to present them to-day
with my secret&mdash;not willingly, mind, but because,
if I do not yield, they will continue to eat
with me, to sleep with me and to walk with
me, to plague my days and curse my nights.
This young lady,' he continued, in an altered
tone, 'came to me with a personal letter from
my cousin, our Ambassador in Paris.  You,
Mr. Lavendale, are here as my nephew's friend.
Now, if you are ready, I will proceed with
the demonstration.'
</p>

<p>
The four men had risen to their feet.  One
of them, a well-set-up, handsome young fellow,
shook hands with Lavendale.
</p>

<p>
'I was a year before you at Harvard, wasn't
I?' he remarked.  'We think that Mr. Moreton
is just a little hard upon us.  We represent,
to use his own words, the undeniable
force, and to do it we have to forget that we
are human, and persist.  This may be very
annoying to Mr. Moreton, but as a rule it is
the world that benefits.'
</p>

<p>
The inventor, who had disappeared for a
moment in the interior of the room which
led out on to the piazza, suddenly stood upon
the threshold.  His face seemed to have become
graver during the last few moments and he
motioned them impatiently back to their places.
Then, with a reel of what seemed to be fine
wire in his hand, he made his way to the further
end of the broad balcony which completely
encircled the house, and carefully stretched
a length of the wire from the edge of the
building to the stone balustrade.  As soon as he
had accomplished this, he drew from his pockets
what appeared to be a pair of black gloves
of some spongy material, and a tiny instrument
about the size of a lady's watch, which
none of them could see.  He drew on the
gloves with great care, placed the instrument
between the palms of his hands and turned
to his nephew.
</p>

<p>
'Just ring the bell there, will you, Jimmy?'
he directed.
</p>

<p>
The young man obeyed.  The little group
now were all standing up, their eyes fixed
upon that strip of thin wire.  Mr. Moreton
slowly drew his palms together several times,
pausing once to glance at the small instrument
which lay concealed between them.  Footsteps
were heard approaching around the side
of the house, and a coloured servant in livery,
carrying a tray in his hand, appeared.  He
had no sooner set his foot upon the wire than
he stopped short, gave a wild jump into the air,
came down again, jumped again, and slowly,
with the salver still in his hand, began to dance.
</p>

<p>
'Touch the bell,' the inventor ordered, in
a voice which seemed tense with suppressed
emotion.
</p>

<p>
His nephew obeyed at once and again there
were footsteps.  Another servant, carrying a
chair, came round the corner, paused for a
moment as though in amazement on perceiving
the antics of his predecessor, stepped on to
the wire, leapt into the air, and commenced
to perform almost similar gyrations.  Mr. Moreton's
breath was coming fast and he seemed
to be the victim of some peculiar emotion.
This time he only glanced towards the bell,
which his nephew pushed.  Again there were
footsteps.  A third servant, with a box of
cigars, appeared, gave a little exclamation at
the extraordinary sight before him, stepped
forward on to the wire, leapt up till his head
almost touched the sloping portico, and
commenced throwing the cigars into the air and
catching them.  Mr. Moreton glanced from the
three performers towards his little audience.
The expression on their faces was absolutely
indescribable.  Meanwhile, the dancing of the
three men in livery became more rapid.  The
man with the salver and glasses began throwing
them into the air and catching them again,
the servant on the outside was now occupied
in balancing a cigar on the tip of his nose,
while his neighbour on the right was twirling
the wicker chair which he had been carrying,
on the point of his forefinger.  Mr. Moreton
stretched out his hand towards the spellbound,
stupefied little company.
</p>

<p>
'The Hamlin Trio, gentlemen, of jugglers
and dancers, imported from the Winter Gardens
at great expense for your entertainment!  Good
morning!'
</p>

<p>
With one bound he was through the window.
They heard the bolt slipped into its place.
From behind the glass he turned and waved
his hand to the newspaper men.  Then he
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
'Spoofed, my God!' the journalist who
had spoken to Lavendale, exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
For a single moment they all looked at
one another.  The trio of entertainers were
redoubling now their efforts.  There was a
roar of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'The joke's on us,' one of the other newspaper
men admitted candidly, 'but what a story!
We'd better get along and write it, you fellows,'
he added, 'before they have it up against us.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there any chance,' a third man inquired,
'of Mr. Moreton talking to us reasonably?'
</p>

<p>
His wife beamed placidly upon them.
</p>

<p>
'Not one chance in this life,' she assured
them.  'If you knew the language poor dear
Ned has used about you gentlemen of the
Press worrying him down at Lakeside during
the last few months, you'd only wonder that
he has let you off so lightly.'
</p>

<p>
'Then perhaps,' Lavendale's acquaintance
suggested, 'we'd better be getting along.'
</p>

<p>
The Hamlin Trio, at the other end of the
piazza, suddenly ceased their labours, made
a collective bow and disappeared.  The newspaper
men still lingered, looking longingly at the
bolted window.  Mrs. Moreton shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'Just leave him alone for a little time,'
she begged.  'He has got a down on you
newspaper gentlemen, and the way they worried
him down at New Jersey has pretty well driven
him crazy.  Don't try him any more this morning,
if you please,' she persisted.  'It's my belief
this little joke he's played on you kept him
out of the hospital.'
</p>

<p>
The silvery-haired old lady, with her earnest
eyes and the little quaver in her tone, triumphed.
The little company reluctantly dispersed.
Lavendale and Suzanne were on the point of
following the others when a head was thrust
cautiously out of a window on the second
storey of the house.
</p>

<p>
'Has the Press of the United States departed?'
Mr. Moreton inquired.
</p>

<p>
'They've all gone, dear,' his wife called
out soothingly.
</p>

<p>
'Then bring the others in to luncheon,'
Mr. Moreton invited.
</p>

<p>
'I'll bring them in right away,' Mrs. Moreton
promised.  'Say, that's a good sign, young
people,' she added, turning to them cheerfully.
'He has hated the sight of company lately,
but I did feel real uncomfortable at sending
you away without any offer of hospitality.
He has locked this window fast enough,' she
added, trying it, 'but come right along with
me and I'll show you another way in.'
</p>

<p>
They followed her along the piazza.  Lavendale
and Suzanne fell a little way behind.
It was their first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
'How long have you been here?' he asked
eagerly.  'What did you come for?  Why
didn't you let me know?'
</p>

<p>
'I have been in New York four days,' she
told him.  'I was on the <i>City of Paris</i>.
We passed you near Queenstown.  As for the
rest, I suppose I am here for the same reason
that you are.  Monsieur Senn, the great
electrician, has been working on the same lines as
Moreton for years, and he persuaded me to
get a letter from the American Ambassador in
Paris and come out here.  I do not suppose,
though, that it is any use.  They say that
Mr. Moreton is like you&mdash;American inventions
for the American people.'
</p>

<p>
'I've wobbled once or twice,' he reminded her.
</p>

<p>
'Of course, there's always a chance,' she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Say that you are glad to see me?' he begged.
</p>

<p>
She gave his hand a little squeeze.  Then
Mrs. Moreton turned round with a motherly
smile.
</p>

<p>
'If you'll take your cocktail in the smoking-room
with Jimmy, Mr. Lavendale,' she said,
'I'll look after Miss de Freyne.' ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Luncheon was a meal of unexpected simplicity,
served by a couple of trim waiting-maids in
a magnificent apartment which overlooked the
Hudson.  Mr. Moreton was in high good-humour
over his latest exploit, and they all indulged
in speculations as to the nature of the stories
which would appear in the evening editions.
Underneath his hilarity, however, Lavendale
more than once fancied that he noted signs of
an immense tension.  Sometimes, in the middle
of a conversation, the great inventor would
break off as though he had lost the thread
of what he had been saying, and look uneasily,
almost supplicatingly around him until some
one supplied him with the context of his speech.
Towards the end of the meal, after a brief silence,
he turned with curious abruptness towards
Lavendale.
</p>

<p>
'Say, you've come a long way to see nothing,
young man,' he remarked.
</p>

<p>
'I have had the pleasure of meeting you,
sir,' Lavendale replied politely, 'and, after
all, I never believed the things they were
saying in London.'
</p>

<p>
'What were they saying?' Mr. Moreton
demanded brusquely.
</p>

<p>
'There was a report there when I left,'
Lavendale answered, 'that you had learnt
at last the secret of handling electricity by
wireless, handling it, I mean, in destructive
fashion.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! they said that, did they?' Mr. Moreton
observed, smiling to himself.
</p>

<p>
'To be absolutely exact,' Lavendale went on,
'they said that you had professed to discover
it.  A great scientific man whom I met only
a few days before I left England, however&mdash;Sir
Hubert Bowden&mdash;assured me that mine
would be a wasted journey because the thing
was impossible.'
</p>

<p>
A suddenly changed man sat in Mr. Moreton's
place.  The unhealthy pallor of his skin
was disfigured by dark red, almost purple
patches.  His eyes were like glittering beads.
He struck the table fiercely with his hairy fist.
</p>

<p>
'Bowden is an ass!' he exclaimed.  'He
is an ignorant numskull, a dabbler, a blind
follower in other men's footsteps.  Impossible
to me&mdash;Moreton?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear!  My dear!' his wife murmured
anxiously from the other end of the table.
</p>

<p>
The inventor turned to one of the servants.
</p>

<p>
'Telephone to the garage for the car to be
here in ten minutes,' he ordered.  'I have
had my little joke,' he went on, as the girl
left the room.  'This afternoon we'll get to
business.'
</p>

<p>
His fury seemed to pass away as suddenly
as it had come.  He ate and drank nervously
but with apparent appetite.  As soon as the
meal was over he commenced smoking a
black cigar, and, excusing himself rather
abruptly, left the room.
</p>

<p>
'Do you suppose,' Lavendale asked his
hostess, 'that he is really going to give us a
demonstration?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' she answered uneasily.  'I
wish I could get him somewhere right away
from every one who talks about inventions
and electricity.  You put his back up, you
know, Mr. Lavendale.  He was quite all right
before you handed him that sort of challenge.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sorry,' Lavendale murmured mendaciously.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes they received an urgent
summons.  They found Mr. Moreton waiting
in a large, open car below.  He had quite
recovered his temper.  His face, indeed, shone
with the benign expression of a child on its
way to a treat.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne and Mr. Lavendale, you
can sit by my side,' he ordered.  'Jimmy, you
get up in front.  The man knows where to go.'
</p>

<p>
They swung round and in a few minutes
turned into Central Park.  At a spot where
the road curved rather abruptly, the car
came to a standstill.  Mr. Moreton stepped
out.  From his pocket he drew a small skein
of what seemed to be white silk, and a tiny
instrument with a dial face and perforated
with several holes.
</p>

<p>
'Hold that,' he directed Lavendale.
</p>

<p>
The latter obeyed.  Mr. Moreton drew the
thread of white silk backwards and forwards
through one of the apertures in the instrument,
the finger on the dial face mounting all the
time from zero.  When it reached a certain
figure he drew it out, and, stooping down,
stretched it across the path from the hedge
to the curbstone.  Then he glanced up and
down and around the corner.  The park was
almost deserted and there were only a few
loungers in sight.  From the small bag which
he had brought with him in the car, Mr. Moreton
next produced a square black box with a handle
in the side, and a pair of black indiarubber
gloves which he hastily donned.  Then, with
the box in his hand, he turned the handle which
protruded from its side.  A queer, buzzing
little sound came from the interior, a sound
which, low though it was, thrilled Lavendale
from its utter and mysterious novelty.  It
was a sound such as he had never imagined,
a sound like the grumblings of belittled and
imprisoned thunder.  The finger on the dial
moved slowly.  When it had reached a certain
point, Mr. Moreton paused.  He clasped the
machine tightly in his hands.  The mutterings
still continued, and from a tiny opening
underneath came little flashes of blue fire.  The
inventor stepped into the car, motioning the
others to follow him, and gave an order to
the driver.  They backed to a spot by the
side of the road, about a hundred yards away
from where the thread of white silk lay stretched
across the pavement.  Mr. Moreton gripped
the instrument in his rubber-clad hand and
leaned back in the car, his eyes fixed upon
the corner.  His expression had become calmer,
almost seraphic.
</p>

<p>
'We shall see now,' he promised them, smiling,
'another land of dance.  There is only one
thing I should like to point out.  The little
instrument I hold in my hand now is adjusted
to any distance up to two hundred yards.  By
turning the handle a dozen more times, the
distance could be increased to a mile, and
more in proportion.  The length of my
silk-covered wire is immaterial.  It could stretch, if
desired, from here to Broadway.  Now watch.'
</p>

<p>
They all sat with their eyes fastened upon
the corner of the pathway.  A slight uneasiness
which Lavendale in particular had felt, was
almost banished by a thrilling sense of
expectancy.  Suddenly a portly figure appeared,
a policeman whom they had passed soon after
entering the park.  He approached with his
hands behind him, walking in ruminating
fashion.  Suddenly, as his foot touched the
thread, he came to a halt.  There was something
unnatural in his momentarily statuesque
attitude.  Then, before their eyes he seemed to
stiffen, fell like a log on his right side, with
his head in the roadway.  His helmet rolled
a few feet away.  The man remained motionless.
Lavendale sprang to his feet but Mr. Moreton
pushed him back.
</p>

<p>
'That is of no consequence,' he said softly.
'Wait for a moment.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale even then would have obeyed
his instinct and jumped from the car, but his
limbs seemed powerless.  A man and a girl, arm
in arm, appeared round the corner.  Suzanne
stood up.  A strange, hysterical impulse seized
her and she tried to shout.  Her voice sounded
like the feeblest whimper.  The two lovers,
as their feet touched the thread, seemed
suddenly to break off in their conversation.  It
was as though the words themselves were
arrested upon their lips, as though all feeling
and movement had become paralyzed.  Then
they, too, stiffened and fell in the same direction.
A park-keeper, who had seen the collapse
of the policeman, came running across the
road, shouting all the time, and an automobile
which had been crawling along, increased its
speed and raced to the spot.  Mr. Moreton
touched a button in the instrument which
he was holding.  The thunder died away and
the blue flashes ceased.  Suzanne leaned back
in the car; her cheeks were as pale as death.
Lavendale bent over her.
</p>

<p>
'It's all right, Suzanne,' he assured her.
'Sit here while I go down.  There is nothing
wrong with those people really.  It's just
another of Mr. Moreton's little jokes.'
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, when Lavendale's feet touched
the ground he gave a little cry, for the earth
seemed quaking around him.  Mr. Moreton,
who was walking by his side, patted him
on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Steady, my boy!  Steady!' he said.  'You
see, the whole of the earth between here and
that little thread of white silk is heavily charged.
You feel, don't you, as though the ground were
rising up and were going to hit you in the
chin.  I've grown used to it.  There goes
poor Jimmy.  Dear me, he hasn't the nerve
of a chicken!'
</p>

<p>
Young Moreton fell over in a dead faint.
Lavendale set his teeth and staggered on.  A
little crowd was already gathering around the
three prostrate bodies as they drew near.
</p>

<p>
'You see,' Mr. Moreton explained reassuringly,
'I have broken the connection now.  Nothing
more will happen.'
</p>

<p>
'What of those three&mdash;the policeman, the
man and the girl?' Lavendale faltered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Moreton patted him on the back.  They
had reached now the outskirts of the little
group.
</p>

<p>
'Theirs,' he said gravely, 'was the real dance.
You have been fortunate, young man.  Your
journey from Europe has been worth while,
after all.  You have seen the Hamlin Trio in
their Jugglers' Dance, and you have seen here
in the sunshine, under the green trees, with
all the dramatic environment possible, the
greatest dance of all&mdash;the dance of death.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale felt the blood once more flowing
freely in his veins.  He turned almost fiercely
upon his companion as he pushed his way
through the gathering crowd.
</p>

<p>
'You don't mean that they are really dead?'
he cried.
</p>

<p>
'Even your wonderful friend Bowden,'
Mr. Moreton assured him sweetly, 'could never
wake a single beat in their hearts again.'
</p>

<p>
An ambulance had just glided up.  A man
who seemed to be a doctor rose to his feet,
shaking the dust from his knees.
</p>

<p>
'These three people are dead,' he pronounced
sombrely.  'The symptoms are inexplicable.'
</p>

<p>
He suddenly recognized Moreton, who held
out his hand genially towards him.
</p>

<p>
'Dr. Praxton, is it not?' he remarked.
'It is very fortunate that I should have so
reliable a witness upon the spot.  I shall be
obliged, doctor, if you will take the bodies
of these fortunate people into your keeping
and prepare a careful examination of their
condition.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you know anything about their death?'
the doctor asked.
</p>

<p>
The great inventor smiled in a superior
fashion.
</p>

<p>
'Why, my dear fellow, yes!' he assented.
'I killed them.  You see that little skein of
what seems to be white silk?  If a million
people had trodden upon it, one after the
other, or if I in my car had been twenty miles
away, with my instrument properly regulated,
there would still be a million dead lying here.
I am Moreton&mdash;Ned Moreton, the inventor,
you know, doctor.  I can strip the universe
of life, if I choose.  I should have liked,'
he added, glancing a little peevishly over
his shoulder, 'the young lady to have seen
this.  I shall make a point of her coming on
to the hospital.'
</p>

<p>
The doctor glanced meaningly at the two or
three policemen who had forced their way
to the front.  They led Mr. Moreton back
to the car, and a few minutes later he was
driven off, seated between them, smoking
a cigar, the picture of amiability.  Suzanne
and Lavendale found a taxicab and left the
park by another exit.  She sat close to him,
clinging to his arm.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne,' he whispered, 'can you be a
woman now for the sake of the great things?'
</p>

<p>
She sat up by his side.  Her face was
marble white, but some latent force seemed
to have asserted itself.  She answered him
steadily.
</p>

<p>
'Go on, Ambrose,' she begged.  'I can listen.
Do not be afraid.'
</p>

<p>
'I have told this man,' he continued, 'to
drive to the docks.  The <i>Marabic</i> is sailing
at five o'clock.'
</p>

<p>
She looked at him for a moment as though
she failed to understand.  His arm tightened
around her.
</p>

<p>
'I have the instruments and a skein of the
thread in my pocket,' he whispered.
</p>

<p>
A sudden light flashed in her eyes.  She
leaned over and kissed him firmly and
deliberately upon the lips.
</p>

<p>
'You are a man, Ambrose,' she declared.
'Do not be afraid.  We are allies, is it not so?'
</p>

<p>
'In this, yes!' he promised her....
</p>

<p>
Two hours later, as they moved slowly down
the river, the tugs shrieking in front of them,
and siren whistles blowing on every side,
they examined for the first time, in the security
of Lavendale's state-room, their new treasures&mdash;the
black, camera-like instrument, the smaller
one, with its dial face, and a little skein of
the white, silk-covered wire.  They both gazed
at them almost in stupefaction&mdash;harmless-looking
objects, silent, dead things.
</p>

<p>
'Only think,' she whispered, clutching his
arm, 'we have but to learn their secret and
we can end the war!'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale hid them away and silently they
stole up on deck.  They heard the engines
quicken their beat, saw the great buildings
of the city fade into an evening mist.  They
saw the lights shoot out from the Statue of
Liberty and felt the ocean breeze on their
cheeks.  They turned their faces eastwards.
The apprehension of great things kept them
silent.  They faced the Unknown.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
AN INTERRUPTED REVUE
</h3>

<p>
Madame Félanie sat before the
gaily-decorated mirror which swung upon
her dressing table, contemplating the result
of her maid's careful and strenuous attentions.
Her dressing-room, during the many months
of her great success, had become transformed
into a little bower of luxury and comfort.  A
telephone stood at her elbow amongst a chaos
of tortoiseshell-backed toilet articles.  There
was a soft green carpet upon the floor, a
wonderful divan in the most comfortable corner, a few
trifles of Empire furniture, an etching or so
upon the wall.  Madame Félanie was a clever
woman and she understood the art of environment.
</p>

<p>
Her costume now for the second act of the
brilliant revue in which her success had been
almost phenomenal, was practically completed.
She wore still a rose-coloured dressing-gown
over garments not remarkable for their
prodigality, and though the evening papers, a
French novel, a little volume of poetry sent
from the author, and a box of Russian cigarettes
stood at her elbow, she still continued to gaze
a little abstractedly at the reflection of her own
features in the looking-glass.  London had
found her beautiful, seductive, vivacious.  She
was all of these.  Her dark and beautifully-set
eyes restrained their gleam of natural
violet notwithstanding the encompassment of
stage make-up.  No rouge could conceal the
pearly brilliancy of her complexion, no cake
of powder the charming lines of her mouth.
It was not at these things, however, that she
looked.  Her eyes were fixed steadily upon
the roots of her blue-black hair, drawn back
from her forehead in a manner peculiar to
herself.  She even raised the tiny magnifying
glass on the table before her, to concentrate
her regard, and there was in her face almost
at that moment a shadow, as though some
faint foreboding was hovering over her, even
in these halcyon days of her great triumph.
</p>

<p>
She laid the magnifying glass down.
</p>

<p>
'It is impossible,' she murmured to herself,
stretching out her hand for a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door.  Her maid
came softly in&mdash;an elderly woman in prim
black, softly-shod and with the art of moving
noiselessly.  She carried a card in her
hand, which she presented to her mistress.
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' she announced, 'this gentleman
desires the favour of a word with you.'
</p>

<p>
Félanie stretched out her hand.
</p>

<p>
'You know so well, Marie,' she complained,
'that I receive here only those who need
send no card.  Give him my address, if it
is a gentleman from the Press.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought madame would prefer to see
this gentleman,' the maid said quietly.
</p>

<p>
Still with a queer reluctance, Félanie took
the card into her white fingers.  Before she
glanced at it she knew very well what name
she would find written there, and she hated
the knowledge.  The black letters stared up at
her&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>Mr. Ambrose Lavendale,<br />
  17 Sackville Street.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Félanie turned her head slowly and looked
upwards at her maid.  The woman's face,
however, was blank.
</p>

<p>
'The gentleman is doubtless known to
Mr. Wiltshaw,' the latter continued.  'He secured
the entrée here without difficulty.  He waits
now in the passage.'
</p>

<p>
'You can show him in,' her mistress ordered.
</p>

<p>
There were a few seconds during which
another woman looked into that gaily-hung
mirror, and another reflection appeared there.
The mouth was no longer seductive, but grim.
The eyes were no longer insolent, half
challenging conquest, half promising tenderness,
but seemed, indeed, to have receded a little,
to be filled with the shrinking light of fear.
The transition was extraordinary and complete.
Here sat a terrified woman, face to face with
some evil thing!
</p>

<p>
Then there came a knock at the door.  As
with the touch of her fingers upon the switch
the gloom of the room was changed into brilliant
light, so Félanie almost miraculously recovered
herself.  She swung round in her dainty revolving
chair.  Her lips, even, fell naturally and
easily into the lines of her most seductive
smile.  What fear there was at the woman's
heart showed itself no longer in her face.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur Lavendale&mdash;Monsieur Ambrose
Lavendale, is it not?' she added, with a
momentary glance at the card.  'You wish
to see me?
</p>

<p>
Lavendale came a little further into the
room and bowed.  At a glance from her
mistress, the maid softly withdrew, closing
the door.  In his severely simple evening clothes,
Lavendale seemed in that little room to be
taller even than his six feet two.  Félanie,
who had risen to her feet, felt herself suddenly
dominated.
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' Lavendale said, 'I have ventured
to present myself in order to renew a very
delightful acquaintance.'
</p>

<p>
She played the game bravely.
</p>

<p>
'But, monsieur,' she protested, 'I have
not the pleasure of knowing you.'
</p>

<p>
He sighed.
</p>

<p>
'It is, alas! then, your memory, madame,
which is at fault.'
</p>

<p>
'Or yours?' she queried softly.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Those who have had the privilege of knowing
the lady who calls herself now Madame
Félanie, could make no mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet it seems,' she persisted, acknowledging
his courtesy with a smile, 'that that is
what has happened.  You are gallant,
monsieur, but there are so many of us upon the
stage who resemble one another.'
</p>

<p>
He shook his head with a self-confidence
which she hated.
</p>

<p>
'There is no man in this world,' he declared,
'who could fail to recognize Adèle Goetz,
even under the guise of Madame Félanie.
May I congratulate you upon your great
success?  Your revue, they tell me, will run
for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'You are very kind,' she said, her knees
beginning to tremble a little, 'but indeed you
are mistaken.  My name is Elaine Félanie.
It is my own name.  I came from the Odéon.  I
am so well-known in Paris.  This lady of whom
you speak perhaps resembled me.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale did not for a moment reply.  His
face had become a shade graver, his grey
eyes held hers.
</p>

<p>
'Is there, then, a reason, madame,' he asked,
'why Adèle Goetz preferred to disappear and
Madame Félanie to rise from her ashes?  Am
I not one of those who could be trusted?
My memories of Mademoiselle Adèle are too
delightful for me to bear anything but
good-will towards Madame Félanie.'
</p>

<p>
She stood for a moment quite still.  Her
brain was working quickly.  After all, the
man was an American.  She looked at him
a little doubtfully.  He smiled&mdash;and she yielded.
She gave him both her hands.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur Ambrose,' she said, 'it can go
on no longer.  I thought myself an actress
but you have conquered.  You are my friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Your devoted friend,' he assured her.
</p>

<p>
'You can imagine, then, why here in England
it is Elaine Félanie alone who exists?'
</p>

<p>
'Adèle Goetz, if I remember rightly,' he
replied, 'was of German birth.'
</p>

<p>
She glanced almost nervously around her.
He went on without pause.
</p>

<p>
'So far as that simple fact is concerned,'
he continued, 'you will not&mdash;you need have
no fear of my discretion.'
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hands again and this
time there was more of invitation in her gesture.
</p>

<p>
'You were always kind to me,' she murmured.
'We shall see something of one another
now, is it not so?'
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Alas! no, madame,' he sighed.  'I am
engaged to be married.'
</p>

<p>
'And mademoiselle is jealous?' she inquired,
with a little pout.
</p>

<p>
'There is no woman in the world,' he told
her, 'who would not be jealous of Madame
Félanie.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed at him with something of her
old gaiety, threw herself back in her chair
and passed him the cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
'We have a few minutes longer, at least,'
she pleaded, 'before we make our pathetic
farewells.  You have not lost the gift of saying
pleasant things, Ambrose.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor you, Adèle, the art of inspiring them,'
he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, là, là!' she exclaimed lightly.  'Tell
me of your life here in London?  Tell me why
you came to renew our acquaintance if it is
to be only a matter of this one visit?'
</p>

<p>
He had refused her offer of a chair and the
cigarette, still unlit, was between his fingers.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I will tell you that,' he said.  'You
read, without a doubt, of the sinking of the
<i>Marabic</i>?'
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Who has talked of anything else in London
these few days?'
</p>

<p>
'I was amongst the saved,' he continued,
'I and the young lady to whom I am engaged
to be married.  We were in the last boat
that left the ship and lost everything except
the clothes we stood up in.  That circumstance
has, to a certain extent, changed my
outlook upon this struggle.'
</p>

<p>
There was the slightest of frowns upon her
velvet brow.  She waited.  He had the air
of one, however, who has concluded all he
has to say.  He turned towards the door.
She stopped him with an imperative gesture.
</p>

<p>
'You have not given me the promise I
desire&mdash;I demand?' she cried.  'Monsieur
Ambrose, you will not leave me like this?'
</p>

<p>
'That promise,' he said gravely, 'is
yours&mdash;conditionally.'
</p>

<p>
His departure was a little abrupt and her
gesture to recall him too late.  She sat for a
moment thinking, a curious shadow upon her
face.  Then she touched the bell.
</p>

<p>
'Ask Monsieur Anders to spare me a moment,'
she directed her maid.
</p>

<p>
There was a brief interval, then the sound
of a cheerful whistling outside.  The door was
opened and Monsieur Anders himself appeared.
He was a small man with a strangely-lined
face, a mouth whose humour triumphed even
over his plastic make-up.  He was attired
with great magnificence in the costume of a
beau of the last century.  His fingers glittered
with rings, lace cuffs fell over his wrists and
a little waft of peculiar perfume entered with
him.  It was not for nothing that for many
years he had been considered upon the French
stage the embodiment of a certain type of
elegance.
</p>

<p>
'You have had a visitor, <i>chérie</i>?' he remarked.
</p>

<p>
'I have,' she replied.  'Shut the door.'
</p>

<p>
He obeyed at once.  From outside came the
voice of the stage carpenter, the occasional
rumbling of scenery, the music of the orchestra,
the murmur now and then of applause.  The
curtain was up upon a fresh scene in the
revue.
</p>

<p>
'Mysterious?' Anders murmured.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, even as the word passed his lips,
apprehension seemed to seize him.  He remained
for a moment dumb and motionless.  Then
he, too, glanced around before he leaned
towards her.
</p>

<p>
'It is trouble?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps not,' she answered.  'One cannot
tell.  A young American has been to see me.
He is one of the few who would remember.
We were friends in Paris nine years ago.  He
was a boy then, but, notwithstanding everything,
he recognized me.'
</p>

<p>
'An American,' Anders muttered.  'Better
that than an Englishman!  Well?'
</p>

<p>
'He was serving his apprenticeship in the
American Diplomatic Service in those days,'
she went on.  'What he is doing now I do
not know, except that he and the girl whom
he is engaged to marry, were amongst
survivors from the <i>Marabic</i>.  He went out
of his way to pay me a visit here, just to tell
me that he recognized me, and he made it plain
that although he is not an Englishman, he is
in sympathy with them.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he threaten?' Anders asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
'No,' she replied, 'and yet he terrified me.
He promised silence&mdash;conditionally.'
</p>

<p>
'Conditionally?  How?'
</p>

<p>
'He left that for me to understand.  I am
still puzzled.  He does not want to see me
any more&mdash;he took pains to tell me that he
was engaged to be married.  Yet underneath
his manner I seemed to discover a threat.'
</p>

<p>
Anders stood perfectly still for a moment.
Underneath all the paint and make-up of his
face, he was suddenly haggard.
</p>

<p>
'Is it worth it, Henri?' she faltered.  'Why
not America at once, and safety?  We could
get a great engagement there.'
</p>

<p>
He stood biting his nails, agitated.
</p>

<p>
'There is this last affair to be carried through,'
he reminded her.  'And the money&mdash;think
of it!  How can one live without money!'
</p>

<p>
'Our salaries,' she murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Pooh!  What man with my tastes could
live on any salary?'
</p>

<p>
'Is it worth while to trifle with life and
death?' she asked him bluntly.  'It is a
warning, this, Henri.'
</p>

<p>
The call-boy's voice was suddenly heard.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur Anders!  Monsieur Anders!'
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman turned mechanically towards
the door.
</p>

<p>
'You have destroyed my nerve,' he muttered.
'You have perhaps ruined my performance.
Afterwards we will see.' ...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was 'French Night' at Luigi's Restaurant,
a gala night even in those strenuous war days.
Every table in the place was taken, and others
had been wheeled in.  The waiters made their
way about with difficulty.  Bohemia and the
sycophantic scions of fashion sat arm in arm.
The grimmer duties of patriotism were for
a moment forgotten.  Its other claims met
with ample recognition.  Félanie sang the
'Marseillaise' twice amidst a scene of wild
applause.  A great French actress from the
legitimate stage had recited a patriotic ode.
The flags on the tables had been sold for absurd
sums by a sympathetic duke who should clearly
have been an auctioneer.  A hundred messages
of sympathy, of love, of faith, were sent across
the wineglasses to the country whom it was
designed to honour.  Back in their corner,
Lavendale and Suzanne looked on curiously.
Once Lavendale drank a little toast with his
companion.
</p>

<p>
'This,' he murmured,' is to our fuller alliance.'
</p>

<p>
She drank with him, although she seemed
a little puzzled.
</p>

<p>
'Listen, dear,' he went on, 'there is just
one little thing I'd like to say to you to-night.
You and I have helped one another at times,
but there has always been a certain reserve.
I told you months ago that I was for America
above all things, and America only.  To-day
I feel differently.  I have been a witness&mdash;you
and I together&mdash;of foul and brutal murder.
I have seen women drowned, have heard their
shrieks.  America may keep the peace with
Germany.  It may be in the interests of the
highest diplomacy that she should.  As for me,
I am at war with Germany.  I am your ally.'
</p>

<p>
Her fingers rested upon his.
</p>

<p>
'Then there is some good,' she whispered,
'which has come out of that great and abominable evil.'
</p>

<p>
'A very small good,' he said, 'but it may
count.  Tell me, do you know who that fair,
almost sandy young man is, sitting at the table
with Félanie and her friends?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' she answered.  'That is Lenwade,
the great flying man.'
</p>

<p>
She dropped her voice suddenly.  The young
man had risen from his chair, and, in the act of
passing down the room to speak to some
acquaintances, paused before their table.  He
bowed to Suzanne and held out his hand to
Lavendale.  They were old acquaintances and
spoke for some time on indifferent subjects.
</p>

<p>
'What have you been doing with yourself
lately?' Lavendale inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Not much flying,' the other confessed.  'I
have been down giving lessons and breaking
in a lot of the youngsters, but I can't stick
it myself as I used to.  Plays the devil with
your nerves.'
</p>

<p>
'Rubbish!' Lavendale laughed.  'You
haven't a nerve in your body.'
</p>

<p>
'Haven't I?' the other replied.  'I remember
the time when I could say that.  I'd give
anything to be at the front now if I felt equal
to it, or if my doctor would let me.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale smiled, and glanced around to
be sure that his neighbours were not listening.
</p>

<p>
'What were you doing at Ypres the week
before last, then?' he asked, dropping his
voice a little.
</p>

<p>
Lenwade for a moment was silent, then he
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'You must have mistaken me for some one
else,' he declared.  'Good-night!'
</p>

<p>
He took his leave a little abruptly.  Lavendale
watched him disappear.  Then he glanced
towards his companion.  His face had become
graver.
</p>

<p>
'Let me put a case to you, my fellow
conspirator,' he begged.
</p>

<p>
'I will put one to you instead,' she replied.
'I know for a fact that Philip Lenwade has
been in France for two months, flying every
day, engaged upon some special task.  He
denies it to us&mdash;quite properly, perhaps&mdash;but
should he come to places like this, should
he drink champagne so that he is compelled
to hold the table while he stands?  It is true
that all the world knows of his infatuation
for Félanie.  She is safe, perhaps&mdash;a Frenchwoman
and a patriot&mdash;yet there is something
about it which I do not like.  She and Lenwade
have been whispering together half the evening,
and more than once I have seen Lenwade
shake his head and push her away.'
</p>

<p>
'Supposing Félanie,' he whispered, 'were
not a Frenchwoman at all?'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne said nothing.  She waited, watching
her companion with wide-open eyes.  Lavendale
looked down upon the tablecloth.
</p>

<p>
'From you,' he continued simply, 'I have
no secrets.  Nine years ago I knew Félanie
in Paris.  She went then by the name of Adèle
Goetz.  She was a German.'
</p>

<p>
'Go on.'
</p>

<p>
'I watched her from the box to-night.  At
first I was oppressed, as I have been before,
by some vague sense of familiarity in her
gestures.  Suddenly&mdash;I think it was the way
she shrugged her shoulders, one higher than
the other&mdash;anyhow, something brought it all
back to me.  That was why I left you, Suzanne.
I went to her room.  Her flaxen hair has become
blue-black, she has altered in many ways but
I discovered that I was right.'
</p>

<p>
'She is a German, posing as a Frenchwoman,
in London to-day?' Suzanne exclaimed.  'Why
does she run this risk?'
</p>

<p>
'That is what I have asked myself,' he
whispered, 'that and another question&mdash;what
is her interest in Lenwade?  Hush!  We are
talking too earnestly.  That fellow Anders&mdash;they
say he is really her husband&mdash;watches
us.  Here comes Luigi.  Talk to him for a
moment.'
</p>

<p>
The manager paused at their table and received
their compliments on the success of the
evening.  When he passed on, Félanie had risen
as though to go, and Lenwade was arranging
her cloak around her shoulders.  Anders was
still talking to some other members of the
company, and friends seated at the great
round table in front of the orchestra.  Félanie
and Lenwade were half-way down the room
before the others began to follow.  Lavendale
rose quickly to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' he said, 'I am going upstairs
and shall come down again just far enough,
in case I can hear anything.  You go through
alone and wait for me on the divan.  Tell
me if those two go away together, and if so,
what is their destination.'
</p>

<p>
They separated at once.  A few minutes
later Lavendale descended from the balcony
and stood just out of sight upon the stairs
which led into the entrance hall.  The little
place was full of the hubbub of cheerful laughter.
On one side, however, Félanie and Lenwade
were talking earnestly.  Félanie had turned
suddenly round to Anders, who had just
arrived.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Lenwade is going to drive me home,'
she announced.  'Au revoir, all you good
people!'
</p>

<p>
There was much handshaking.
</p>

<p>
'Vive la France, madame,' a young Englishman
exclaimed fervently, as he bent over
Félanie's fingers, 'and may you, too, live for
ever!'
</p>

<p>
'If one would paint France, madame,' a
painter murmured, 'I would choose you for
the emblematic figure.'
</p>

<p>
There were more compliments, another little
burst of patriotic fervour.  Some one even
struck up a few bars of the 'Marseillaise' as
Félanie and her escort disappeared.  Lavendale
descended the last few stairs and elbowed his
way good-humouredly through the group.  He
took Suzanne by the arm.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' he whispered, as he led her towards
the doorway.
</p>

<p>
'I am not sure,' she answered under her
breath, 'but I think they went to his
rooms&mdash;number 25 Half Moon Street.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale's car was a few minutes delayed.
He gave the man the address almost in a whisper.
Behind, pushing his way out on to the pavement,
was Anders.  He watched Lavendale drive
off with a slightly disturbed air.
</p>

<p>
'What are you going to do?' Suzanne asked.
</p>

<p>
'Make a fool of myself, very likely,' Lavendale
replied.  'I am just working out a theory,
that's all.  She is going back to his rooms.
Anders remains behind, content, and all the
world knows that Anders, whether he is her
husband or not, is in love with her and furiously
jealous.  You see, there must be a reason
for her little expedition.  She is hoping to
fetch something.'
</p>

<p>
'Where are we going?'
</p>

<p>
'To his rooms,' Lavendale explained.  'Oh! don't
look startled, dear.  I shall have a very
good explanation to offer to Lenwade, even
if I break in upon the most ordinary amour.'
</p>

<p>
They were in Half Moon Street within a
few minutes.  Just as Lavendale's car slackened
speed, Félanie issued from the door of number
25, and, looking neither to the right nor to the
left, sprang into a waiting taxicab and drove
off.  Lavendale leaped out on to the pavement.
</p>

<p>
'Follow her, Suzanne,' he directed.  'I hope
to God she's going straight home!  If not,
you must find out where she does go.  I'll
come in a taxi.  I must see Lenwade first.'
</p>

<p>
He whispered a direction to the chauffeur,
passed through the door of number 25, rang
for an automatic lift and ascended to the second
storey.  Leaning over the banisters, as the
lift stopped, was Lenwade.  He gazed at his
visitor in amazement.
</p>

<p>
'What the mischief are you doing here, old
fellow?' he asked thickly.
</p>

<p>
'Whom are you looking for?' Lavendale retorted.
</p>

<p>
'Madame Félanie,' the other confessed.  'She
has gone down to fetch her vanity case from the
cab.  Can't think why she doesn't come back.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale pushed him suddenly back into
his room and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
'You idiot!' he thundered.  'She isn't
coming back!  Now pull yourself together, do you
hear?  Listen to me.  You're half drunk, but
I am going to tell you something that ought
to sober you.  That woman Félanie is a born
German, and a spy.  What have you given her?'
</p>

<p>
Even through the bluster of his stormy denial,
Lenwade was obviously shaken.
</p>

<p>
'What bally rot!' he exclaimed.  'She's
a Frenchwoman to her finger-tips.  They all
love her.  Didn't you hear her sing&mdash;Marseillaise?
Frenchwoman to her finger&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Shut up!' Lavendale interrupted fiercely.
'I tell you I knew her nine years ago under
another name.  She is a German, and it's my
belief she's a spy, she and Anders.  What
have they worked on you?  Out with it, man!'
</p>

<p>
Lenwade swayed on his feet.  He looked
back across his shoulder to a roll-top writing
desk which stood open.  Then he snatched up
a tumbler from the table by his side, filled it
with soda-water and drank it off.
</p>

<p>
'Lavendale, you're not in earnest!'
</p>

<p>
'In God's own earnest, man!  Quick, if
you want to repair the mischief you've done,
tell me what you gave her?'
</p>

<p>
'I've lent her my plans,' Lenwade faltered.
'I've been two months making them, up above
the clouds.  I'm the only real draughtsman
amongst those who can keep high enough&mdash;plans
of the German fortifications and the railways
behind, from the coast beyond where our
lines touch the French.  I say, Lavendale&mdash;&mdash;!'
</p>

<p>
There was no Lavendale.  He sprang down
the stairs three at a time, out into the street
and at a double into Piccadilly, where he sprang
into a passing taxicab.
</p>

<p>
'Milan!  Look sharp!' he ordered.
</p>

<p>
The man drove swiftly through the half-empty
streets.  With a little gasp of relief
Lavendale recognized his own car waiting in
the courtyard.  Without a pause, however,
he pushed open the swing doors of the Court
and leaned over the counter towards the night
porter.
</p>

<p>
'What is Madame Félanie's number?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Sixty-four, sir,' the man replied, glancing
dubiously at Lavendale.  'Monsieur Anders is
up there now, however.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale stepped into the lift, ascended
to the third floor, hurried down the dimly-lit
corridor and paused outside the door of
number sixty-four.  He listened for a moment.
Inside he could hear voices.  Then he pressed
the bell.  There was a moment's hesitation,
then Anders' voice speaking in French.
</p>

<p>
'Lenwade, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
He heard Félanie's scornful little laugh, the
flutter of her garments as she crossed the room.
The door was suddenly opened and she stood
there, looking out at him.  She gazed at this
unexpected visitor and the colour slowly faded
from her cheeks and the light from her eyes.
Lavendale made his way firmly across the
threshold and closed the door.  Félanie caught
at her throat.
</p>

<p>
'What do you want here, sir?' Anders demanded.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale pushed them both back into the
sitting-room.  There was an ugly look in the
man's face, but Félanie's courage seemed to have
deserted her.  She clutched at the air for a
moment and sank into an easy-chair, hiding
her face amongst the cushions.  Lavendale's
hand fell firmly upon the loose sheets of paper
strewn over the table.
</p>

<p>
'These are what I have come for,' he
announced, collecting them and thrusting them
into his pocket.  'I presume you have had no
time to make a copy?'
</p>

<p>
He glanced searchingly around the apartment.
It was obvious that nothing of the sort had
been attempted.  Anders stole slowly back
towards the writing-table, his hand was upon
the knob of one of the drawers, but Lavendale
suddenly gripped him by the coat collar and
swung him almost off his feet.
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' he said coldly, 'I know nothing
of you, Anders, except that it is my belief that
you are one of the vermin of the war, a spy
selling his own country.  The woman there
was once my friend.  For that reason, if
you leave England on Saturday for America,
this matter is finished.  If either of you remain
in London, or make any attempt to cross to
Holland, France or any other country, between
now and then, something very ugly will happen.
You understand?'
</p>

<p>
Anders' courage had failed him pitifully.
Félanie, on the contrary, had recovered herself.
</p>

<p>
'I have been a fool, perhaps,' she confessed.
'You were just one of the few chances against
me.  Very well, we go to America on Saturday.'
</p>

<p>
'But our contract?' Anders faltered.  'The
revue?  Elaine's success?  They have doubled
our salaries.  London is at her feet.'
</p>

<p>
'After Saturday,' Lavendale reminded him
calmly, 'the best that can happen to you,
Anders, is a bandaged forehead and twelve
bullets, in the courtyard of the Tower.  I
will not offend your taste by suggesting&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Félanie stamped her foot and turned her
shoulder contemptuously upon Anders.
</p>

<p>
'It is finished, Monsieur Lavendale,' she
pronounced.  'If there were any bribe in
the world I could offer you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
It was her one rather faint-hearted effort
and he laughed at the seduction in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You will be watched from this moment
until the steamer leaves Liverpool,' he
concluded, leaving the room and closing the door
behind him....
</p>

<p>
In the hall he met Lenwade, waiting for
the lift, incoherent still but sober.  Lavendale
drew him out into the courtyard, where
Suzanne was still seated in the car.
</p>

<p>
'Lenwade,' he announced, 'I have your
plans.  They are safe with me.  I shall keep
them until to-morrow morning.  You can come
to me at 17 Sackville Street at ten o'clock.
Until then they will be safe.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank God!' the other murmured.  'How
did you manage it?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale shook him off a little contemptuously
and took his place by Suzanne's side.
</p>

<p>
'They leave on Saturday for Liverpool,'
he told her.  'I hand the care of them, from
now until then, over to your branch.'
</p>

<p>
She pressed his hand and drew a little closer
to him.
</p>

<p>
'My dear ally!' she murmured.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br />
THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT
</h3>

<p>
Lavendale was closeted with a Personage,
and the interview to which he found
himself committed came as something of a
shock to him.  The Personage was not in the
habit of wasting his words, and he spoke
succinctly and to the point.
</p>

<p>
'To sum up, Mr. Lavendale,' he concluded,
'we have received direct and categorical
complaints concerning you, forwarded to us through
the German Ambassador in Washington.  It is
stated that whilst enjoying the shelter and
privileges of your association with the Embassy
here, you have rendered direct aid to a Branch of
the French Secret Service in this country, and
that you were yourself responsible for the
interception of an important communication from
Berlin.'
</p>

<p>
'That's Leonard Johnson,' Lavendale muttered.
</p>

<p>
'The case of Leonard Johnson has, I believe,
been cited,' the Personage admitted, 'but
your association with a certain member of the
French Secret Service has led you, I am
informed, into further enterprises not entirely
in accordance with your position as an American
official.'
</p>

<p>
'Am I to understand that you wish me to
resign, sir?' Lavendale asked.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' the Personage replied cheerfully,
'is further from my intentions.  I wish you to
reform.  Remember you are an American, that's
all.  Now go and pay us a visit on the other
side.  I am coming in to do a little hand-shaking
myself presently.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale put behind him what he felt
might be one of the crises of his life, and made
his way to the ambassadorial reception rooms.
He paid his respects to his Chief's wife and
family and talked for a while to one of the
junior secretaries.  A clean-shaven man, tall and
slim, with gold spectacles and smooth hair,
came up to them presently with a smile.
</p>

<p>
'I hope you haven't quite forgotten me,
Mr. Lavendale,' he said.  'I'm Anthony Silburn.
Four years before your time, but we've
met once or twice in New York.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' Lavendale assented.  'As a
matter of fact, we are connections, aren't we?
You married my cousin, Lydia Green.'
</p>

<p>
They sat in a corner and talked for some
time of common acquaintances.  Mr. Anthony
Silburn, besides having the advantage of a
frank and engaging manner and a distinct
sense of humour, was, as Lavendale very well
knew, one of the wealthiest and most
enlightened of American millionaires.
</p>

<p>
'I tell you what it is, young fellow,'
Mr. Silburn declared, as they parted, 'you'll have
to come down and spend a week-end with us,
any time you like.  I've got a real old country
house in Norfolk&mdash;leased it before the war
broke out&mdash;Hookam Court, near Wells.  Bring
your guns down.  Well, I'm off now to catch
the five o'clock train home.'
</p>

<p>
He departed, with a little farewell nod.
Lavendale looked after him thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
'One of the most successful men in America,'
somebody by his side remarked.  'I wonder
what he thinks about the war.  He was
educated in Germany&mdash;I am not sure that he
wasn't born there.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale made his adieux a little later and
walked thoughtfully towards the Milan Court.
He sent his name up, but there was no reply
from Suzanne's rooms.
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne went out on Monday night,'
the hall-porter told him.  'She was motoring,
I think, but she had very little luggage.
She hasn't been back since.  We've had
a great many telephone messages for her.'
</p>

<p>
The circumstance was not in itself unusual,
but Lavendale was conscious of a queer little
feeling of uneasiness.  Suzanne never left town
without letting him know and she had been
engaged to dine with him that night.
</p>

<p>
'I think I'll go up and speak to her maid,'
he said.
</p>

<p>
The man pointed towards the lift.
</p>

<p>
'There she is, sir, just come in.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale crossed the hall and touched the
woman on the shoulder.  She was a dark-visaged,
melancholy-looking person of middle
age, with an extraordinary gift for taciturnity.
</p>

<p>
'Do you know where your mistress is,
Anne?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
The woman appeared to recognize him with
some relief.  She evaded a direct reply, however.
</p>

<p>
'Would you be so kind as to come upstairs,
sir?' she invited.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale followed her to Suzanne's suite.
She stood on one side for him to enter and
closed the door carefully.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur,' she began, 'my mistress once
told me that if there was trouble I was to come
to you.'
</p>

<p>
'Quite right,' Lavendale assented quickly.
'What is it?'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle left me at six o'clock on
Monday night,' the maid proceeded.  'I know
nothing as to her destination except that her
journey was decided upon quite suddenly and
that she had a motor ride of over a hundred
miles.  She expected to be back the next day.
If not, she promised to send me some instructions.
Since then I have heard nothing of her.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale reflected for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'How much are you in your mistress'
confidence?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'She has trusted me often with her life,'
was the quiet reply.
</p>

<p>
'You understand her real position?'
</p>

<p>
'But naturally.'
</p>

<p>
'Then do you know,' Lavendale went on,
'if there is any headquarters of the French
Secret Service in this country&mdash;any one from
whom we could get any idea as to her mission?'
</p>

<p>
The woman shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'There are others working often with
Mademoiselle,' she said.  'I know no names&mdash;only
this.  In case of the very deepest anxiety, but
only in extremes, I have a telephone number
here which I could ring up.'
</p>

<p>
She opened her purse and drew out a slip of
paper.
</p>

<p>
'It is, I believe, a private number,' she
continued, 'and not in the book.  I made up
my mind that if Mademoiselle had not returned
this afternoon, I would ring up.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us do so at once,' Lavendale suggested.
</p>

<p>
'If monsieur would be so kind,' she begged,
pointing to the instrument.  'My English is
not good, and I do not know with whom I
should speak.'
</p>

<p>
'Whom am I to ask for?' Lavendale inquired.
</p>

<p>
'No names are to be mentioned,' the woman
replied, 'and the number can only be rung up
between five and seven.  It is six o'clock now,'
she added.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale took off the receiver and asked
for the number.  There was a moment's pause.
Then a remarkably clear voice answered him.
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'It is a friend of Mademoiselle de Freyne
who speaks,' Lavendale said.
</p>

<p>
'That is well,' the voice replied.  'Continue.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss de Freyne left her rooms at the Milan
Court last Monday night, on secret business.
She promised to communicate with her maid
the next day.  She has not done so.  She left
in a motor-car and with very little luggage.
She made the remark that she had a ride of
over a hundred miles.'
</p>

<p>
'That is all you know, Mr. Lavendale?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale started a little at the sound of his
own name.
</p>

<p>
'It is all,' he assented.
</p>

<p>
'Kindly go and repeat what you have told
me to Major Elwell, room 17, number 33,
Whitehall.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale replaced the receiver and turned
to Anne.
</p>

<p>
'I am instructed,' he said, 'to apply to a
man whom I know to be in the English Secret
Service.'
</p>

<p>
'It would be well,' the maid advised, 'if
monsieur applied there at once.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale walked briskly out of the Milan
by the back exit, through the Gardens, along
the Embankment and into Whitehall.  He
found number 33 a long, narrow, private house
taken over by the Government.  Number 17
consisted of a small office in which two men
were busy writing, and an inner room.
Lavendale made his inquiry and was told that
Major Elwell would be back in an hour.  He
scribbled a note, making an appointment, and
walked back to his own rooms.  He let himself
in, paused to speak for a moment with his
servant, who was laying out his clothes, and
turned towards the sitting-room.  As he opened
the door the telephone bell began to ring
insistently.  He crossed the room, took up
the receiver, and tapped the instrument.
</p>

<p>
'What is it?' he asked.  'Hullo?  Hullo?'
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the distance he heard a voice
say faintly&mdash;'Trunk call'&mdash;and for a moment
he was patient.  Then he gave a little start.
A familiar voice, yet unfamiliar, shaking with
something like fear, tremulous, hysterical,
terrified, murmured his name.  His heart leapt
with quick sympathy, his fingers shook.
</p>

<p>
'Ambrose!  Ambrose!  Is that you?  Speak
quickly!'
</p>

<p>
'I am here, Suzanne,' he cried.  'Where
are you?'
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he seemed to hear turmoil and
confusion, a man's voice, a woman's shriek.
</p>

<p>
'At Hook&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Then there was silence.  The connection
had been broken.  Lavendale rang up furiously.
At last he got the exchange.  The young man who
answered his inquiry could tell him nothing.
He rang through to the inquiry office with
little better result.  They would make inquiries
and let him know from whence the call came.
They believed that it was from a call office.
He could gain no further information.  He set
down the instrument at last in despair and
walked up and down the room.  She was in
trouble, danger.  'Hook&mdash;?' 'Hook&mdash;?'  What
was there familiar to him in the
commencement of that word?  He repeated it
feverishly.  Then he remembered&mdash;Hookam
Court&mdash;Anthony Silburn, whom he had met that
afternoon at the Embassy.  It was hard to
discover any connection, however.  He drove
back to the Milan Court and found Anne.
</p>

<p>
'Is there any news, monsieur?' she asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'None at present,' Lavendale replied.  'I
cannot see Major Elwell for another half-hour.
Tell me, have you ever heard your
mistress mention any place of which the first
syllable is "Hook"?'
</p>

<p>
'"Ook,"' Anne repeated dubiously.  'No, monsieur!'
</p>

<p>
'Hookam Court,' Lavendale went on,
'Anthony Silburn&mdash;Norfolk&mdash;none of that is
familiar?'
</p>

<p>
'But no, monsieur!'
</p>

<p>
He kept the secret of the telephone message
to himself and made his way round once more
to Whitehall.  Major Elwell was seated in his
office and received him at once.  There was
nothing unusual about the place except a large
array of telephones.  Lavendale told his story
quickly.  The Major listened without comment.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' Lavendale asked eagerly, when he
had finished.
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell was occupied in drawing small
diagrams with his pencil on the edge of the
blotting-paper.
</p>

<p>
'We must see what can be done,' he remarked
at last.  'Hook'&mdash;that is absolutely
all you heard?'
</p>

<p>
'Absolutely,' Lavendale assured him.
</p>

<p>
'And you have a friend who lives at Hookam
Court in Norfolk&mdash;Mr. Anthony Silburn?' he
said meditatively.  'A very remarkable man,
Silburn&mdash;likely to be President some day, they
tell me.'
</p>

<p>
'Who cares about that!' Lavendale
exclaimed, a little curtly.  'What can we do,
Major Elwell?  I dare say you know as much
as I do, and more.  Miss de Freyne has been
very successful during the last few months, and
there is no doubt they'd give anything they
could to get hold of her on the other side.  But
in England&mdash;surely there can't be any organization
over here strong enough for actual
mischief!'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely,' Major Elwell agreed.  'Scarcely.
'H&mdash;double O&mdash;K,' he went on meditatively.
'You see, there are about fifty places in the
United Kingdom beginning like that.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale felt his courage slipping away.
There was something curiously unimpressive
in the carefully-dressed, imperturbable Englishman,
who was occupied now in polishing his
eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
'Isn't there anything we can be doing instead
of sitting here talking?' he asked impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'Always a mistake,' Major Elwell declared,
'to do things in a hurry.  Have a cigarette,' he
went on, offering his case.  'I think I'll stroll
out and talk with a friend over this little matter.'
</p>

<p>
'Isn't there a thing I can do?' Lavendale
persisted.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' Major Elwell said thoughtfully, 'you
spoke of an invitation to visit your friend
Mr. Anthony Silburn at Hookam Court.  Why
not motor down there to-morrow?  It's one
of the places in the country that your call
might have come from, at any rate.'
</p>

<p>
A derisive reply quivered upon Lavendale's
lips.  Then, for some reason or other, he
changed his mind and remained silent.  Major
Elwell, without any appearance of hurrying
him, was holding the door open.
</p>

<p>
'All right,' Lavendale agreed, 'I'll motor
down there to-morrow.'
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Lavendale was conscious of a queer sensation
of unreality as late on the following afternoon
he followed the butler across the white-flagged
entrance hall of Hookam Court.  He
felt as though he were an unwilling actor in
a play of which the setting was all too perfect.
The little party of guests, still in shooting
clothes and lounging before the great wood
fire, brought into their surroundings a vivid
note of flamboyant artificiality.  The high
walls, with their ecclesiastically-curved
frescoes, the row of family portraits, the armour
standing in the recesses, even the little local
touch afforded by the game-keeper in brown
whipcord and gaiters, standing waiting in a
distant corner, seemed to him like part of some
cinema production in which the men and
women were supers and the setting tinsel.
</p>

<p>
His host's greeting was all that it should have
been.  He advanced across the hall with
outstretched hand, quietly but sincerely cordial.
</p>

<p>
'Good man, Lavendale!' he exclaimed.  'I
was delighted to get your telegram.'
</p>

<p>
'Very nice of you,' Lavendale murmured.
'I hadn't any idea of being at a loose end so
soon when you were kind enough to ask me.'
</p>

<p>
'It couldn't have happened more fortunately,'
Mr. Anthony Silburn assured him.  'I've
another man coming down to-night, but I've
room for two more guns.  Now let me introduce
you to those of your fellow-guests whom you
don't know.  Mr. Lavendale&mdash;Lady Marsham,
Mr. Kindersley, Mr. Barracombe, Sir
Julius Marsham, Mr. Henry D. Steinletter.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale bowed, individually to the women
and collectively to the men.  Lady Marsham,
a stout, dark-haired lady with a heavy jaw,
made room for him by her side.
</p>

<p>
'It is quite a treat, Mr. Lavendale,' she
declared, 'to see a young man.  One feels
that he must be either an American or a hopeless
invalid.  You are an American, aren't you?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale admitted the fact and rose to
welcome his hostess, who was coming down the
stairs.  She suddenly recognized Lavendale
and stopped short.  For the first time he was
conscious of something which freed him from
that sense of being part of a carefully concerted
picture.  There was something absolutely human,
entirely spontaneous in his cousin's expression
as she recognized him.  Her fingers gripped the
oak banisters, her lips were parted, her eyes
were filled with something which was scarcely a
welcoming light.  It all passed in a moment and
she came into the picture naturally and easily.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Ambrose, how delightful to see you
again!  Does Tony know?
</p>

<p>
Lavendale advanced to meet her and took her
hands.
</p>

<p>
'He asked me down for a few days only
yesterday, when I met him in town, and I wired
to say that I was coming to-day.  I am afraid
I didn't give him a chance to turn me down,
but I meant to say, although he hasn't given
me an opportunity yet, that if it's at all
inconvenient I could go on to Norwich and look
up some friends near there.
</p>

<p>
For a single moment she hesitated.  Her
little laugh was not altogether natural.  Again
Lavendale had a queer fancy that there was
a leaven of insincerity in her welcome&mdash;that
if it had been possible she would even
have sent him away.
</p>

<p>
'Don't be foolish, Ambrose.  Of course we
are delighted.  I see you people have had
tea,' she went on.  'I really couldn't resist a
bath and tea-gown.'
</p>

<p>
'And I was much too lazy,' Lady Marsham
yawned, lighting a cigarette.  'I shall go up
and change early for dinner.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Silburn's voice was heard from the other
end of the hall.  He was dismissing the
game-keeper with a few parting instructions.
</p>

<p>
'I'll have another covering stand at the long
wood, Reynolds,' he was saying.  'You can put
it on the extreme left, near the old oak.  I'll
take that myself, and Mr. Lavendale will shoot
from number three.  You've got your guns,
Lavendale?' he added, strolling up to them.
</p>

<p>
'They are in the car,' Lavendale replied,
'but I warn you that I haven't shot for two
years.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think my pheasants will bother
you any,' Mr. Silburn promised him.  'Barracombe
here finds them on the slow side.  We
had a very good day to-day&mdash;over a thousand
head altogether.  Sure you won't have some
tea or a whisky-and-soda?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing, thanks.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I'll show you your rooms,' his host
continued, 'if you'll come this way.'
</p>

<p>
Lydia Silburn, who had been standing a
little irresolutely on the other side of the round
tea-table, suddenly turned towards her husband.
</p>

<p>
'Why didn't you tell me, Tony, that Ambrose
was coming?' she inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I meant to,' her husband admitted.  'As
it happens, however, I haven't seen much of
you to-day, have I?  Come along, young
fellow.  Did you bring a servant, by-the-by?
No?  Well, I've quite a smart second boy who
can look after you.  We dine at eight.  And,
Lavendale, just one word,' he concluded, as
he glanced around the spacious rooms into
which he had ushered his guest, 'we have a
sort of unwritten rule to which every one
subscribes here.  It saves so much unpleasant
argument on a subject where our opinions are a
little divided.  We don't mention the war until
half-past ten.'
</p>

<p>
'Very sound,' Lavendale remarked, 'but
why half-past ten?'
</p>

<p>
'After dinner,' Mr. Silburn promised, 'I
will explain that to you.  We have a little
conversazione sometimes&mdash;but just wait.' ...
</p>

<p>
Again, an hour or so later, when Lavendale
stood once more in the hall talking to one or
two of the men, whilst a footman was passing
round cock-tails upon a tray, he felt oppressed
by that curious sense of unreality.  He took
himself severely to task for it.  He told himself
that it must lie simply in the innate incongruity
of this occupation of a ducal home by an
American millionaire.  In every other respect
the men and women were obviously fitting
figures.  One or two of them were even known
to him by reputation.  The whole atmosphere
of their conversation was natural and
spontaneous.   And then, as he turned resolutely to
continue a discussion about wild pheasants
with Barracombe&mdash;Barracombe, whom he knew
well to be a great scientific traveller, a man
of distinction&mdash;it was then that the climax
came, the dramatic note which alone was needed
to convince him of the spuriousness of his
surroundings.  He had turned his head quite
naturally towards the broad, western corridor
on hearing the soft rustling of a woman's
skirts&mdash;and he talked no more of wild pheasants!
It was Suzanne, in a black evening gown and
carrying a handful of pink roses in her hand,
who was coming slowly across the hall.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne!  Miss de Freyne!' he exclaimed,
taking a quick step forward.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious of many things in those
few seconds, conscious of his host's strenuous
regard, of Suzanne's unnatural pallor, of the
warning in her eyes.  His rush of joy at seeing
her, however, was all-conquering.  He took
her hands in his and held them tightly.
</p>

<p>
'And to think that no one told me you
were here!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's strained silence.
Then a cold wave of doubt, a premonition of
evil, suddenly chilled him.  In the background
he had caught a glimpse of a peculiar smile
upon his host's lips, and again there was the
warning in Suzanne's eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I have been down in the neighbourhood for
several days,' she told him.  'It is rather a
coincidence, is it not?'
</p>

<p>
Anthony Silburn, who had remained all the
time within earshot, strolled over towards
them.
</p>

<p>
'So you young people have discovered one
another,' he remarked.  'The gong at last!'
he added, with a little burst of enthusiasm.
'Lavendale, as it is your first evening, will you
take Lydia in?  Miss de Freyne, I am going
to give myself the happiness to-night.'
</p>

<p>
He held out his arm and led Suzanne away.
Lavendale loitered behind with his cousin.
</p>

<p>
'Lydia,' he whispered, as they passed into
the great dining-room, 'how long has Miss
de Freyne been here?'
</p>

<p>
'In this house since the day before yesterday,'
she answered.  'She was staying before
at the Hookam Arms, down in the village.'
</p>

<p>
'Say, is there anything wrong about this
place?' he asked.  'I don't know what it is,
but I feel as though I'd come into some sort
of a theatrical performance.  I suppose you
are all alive, aren't you?  That really is
Barracombe, the traveller, and old Steinletter?'
</p>

<p>
His tone had been one of half banter, but her
reply made him suddenly serious.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know, Ambrose,' she confessed
nervously.  'Sometimes I feel like that myself.
Don't talk too loudly.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale became a watcher through the
progress of the wonderfully served meal.  The
servants, in a way, were all of the usual type,
obviously well-trained and attentive.  The
dining-room at Hookam had been built out by a
favourite of one of the Georges almost in the
form of a pagoda, and under the high, domed
roof, listening to the somewhat stereotyped
conversation of those strangely-assorted guests,
Lavendale became slowly conscious of a new
sensation, the sensation of restriction.  It was
hard to believe that outside lay the park; that
in the morning he would be wandering about,
free to come and go as he pleased; that in the
garage was his own car, and a couple of miles
away across the park, the road to London.
He tried to talk lightly to Lydia of their
relatives and friends in America, but he found her
distraite and depressed.  Dinner was no sooner
over, however, than he made a bold attempt
to dissipate some of his presentiments.
</p>

<p>
'Can I use the telephone, Silburn?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure, my dear boy,' was the
unhesitating reply.  'You'll find an instrument
this way.'
</p>

<p>
They were all crossing the hall.  The men
and the women were to smoke and take their
coffee together.  Silburn led his young guest
into a small waiting-room, comfortably
furnished.  On a table in the middle of the
apartment was a telephone instrument and a book
of subscribers.  Lavendale took up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
'Can you get through to London?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry, sir, the line is engaged,' the operator
regretted.
</p>

<p>
'Will it be free presently?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll ring up as soon as we can get through.
What number?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale gave the number of his own rooms
and rejoined the little group in the hall.  He
found Barracombe on one side of Suzanne and
his host on the other, but he drew a chair as near
to her as he could.
</p>

<p>
'Get through all right?' Silburn inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I didn't get through anywhere,' Lavendale
replied.  'The line was engaged.'
</p>

<p>
'We've a lot of soldiers down here,' Mr. Silburn
explained.  'They are always commandeering
the line for military purposes.'
</p>

<p>
'You seem to get plenty of messages,'
Lavendale remarked, as a servant for the third or
fourth time brought a slip of folded paper to
his master.
</p>

<p>
Silburn smiled.
</p>

<p>
'I have a private line,' he announced.  'Sorry
I can't ask you to use it, but I have promised
the military here that no one else save myself
shall communicate by means of it.  Are you
a bridger, Lavendale?'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale excused himself, but gained nothing,
for Suzanne was almost forced into the game
by her host.  He wandered about the hall,
glancing up at the pictures.  Then he went back
to the telephone room.
</p>

<p>
'Line's still engaged, sir,' was the laconic
reply to his inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale strolled back.  He wandered
uneasily about the hall for a time and then
approached the great front door.
</p>

<p>
'Think I'll have a look at the night,'
he remarked, with his hand upon the bolt.
</p>

<p>
The servant who was standing by, intervened.
</p>

<p>
'I beg your pardon, sir,' he said, 'we are
not allowed to open the front door after dusk.
The military have complained so much about
the lights.'
</p>

<p>
'Show me another way out from the back,
then?' Lavendale persisted.
</p>

<p>
'No one is allowed to leave the house at all
until morning,' the man told him.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale turned slowly round towards the
bridge-table.
</p>

<p>
'Silburn,' he asked, 'are we prisoners?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear fellow,' his host replied, dealing
out a hand, 'it is not I who am to blame, but
the English military authorities.  Look how
closely-curtained we are everywhere.  You will
find double blinds in every room in the house.
Yet even that has not been enough to satisfy
them.  I have had to promise that no members
of my household shall even open a door after
dark.  "Defence of the Realm Act" they call
it, I think.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale turned a little discontentedly away.
It was difficult to protest further, but he was
not in the least satisfied that Silburn's
explanation was a genuine one.  He talked for a
few moments to several of the other guests and
then drew a low chair up close to Suzanne.  It
was evident to him, watching her closely, that she
was playing under great tension.  More than
ever he was convinced that something was
wrong.  With an excuse about fetching some
cigarettes of a particular brand, he made up
to his room and searched in his dressing-case.
Within a few minutes he found himself face
to face with a very grim reality.  The revolver
which he carried always with him had been
removed! ...
</p>

<p>
Lavendale, with small hopes of any success,
called once more at the telephone room before
he rejoined the little party.  The reply was
almost brusque.
</p>

<p>
'Line blocked.  No chance of getting through
to London to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Can I ring up Norwich?' Lavendale asked,
with a sudden inspiration.
</p>

<p>
'Line to Norwich engaged,' was the reply.
</p>

<p>
'Is there anywhere I can speak to?' Lavendale
persisted.  'Is there any number upon the
exchange I can be connected with?'
</p>

<p>
There was no reply.  He rang again and
tapped the wire.  There was still silence.  Then
he replaced the receiver upon the instrument
and stood for a moment in the little room,
thinking.  There was no doubt but that he had
simply followed Suzanne into a trap.  He
rapidly reviewed in his memory the guests.
Lady Marsham, it was well known, had been
educated in Berlin and had German relatives.
Barracombe wore an order conferred upon him
by the Kaiser.  Steinletter belonged to the
greatest German-American banking firm in the
world.  Kindersley's daughter had married an
Austrian prince.  Suzanne had succeeded, then,
in this last quest of hers, a success which,
although inadvertently, he might be said to share.
They had in all probability discovered the
headquarters of the great Teutonic espionage
system in England.  How was it going to
profit them?  His mind rapidly reviewed the
situation.  They were prisoners&mdash;of that he
was certain&mdash;yet to what extent?  How far
was Silburn prepared to go?  It was, after all,
rather an opera-bouffe sort of trap.  If they
were caught, there was still the question of
silencing them.  Then he thought of that
abstracted revolver, and a queer little wave
of apprehension, not for himself but for Suzanne,
suddenly chilled him.
</p>

<p>
He made his way back into the hall.  The
rubber was just over and he leaned boldly
over the chair in which Suzanne was seated.
</p>

<p>
'Come and talk to me for a few minutes,' he
begged.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.  Mr. Silburn, who was playing
idly with the cards, glanced at the clock and
back again.
</p>

<p>
'At half-past ten,' he announced, 'in ten
minutes, that is to say, we all meet in the
cloister room.  It is a queer custom, perhaps,
but my guests have been kind in conforming
to it.'
</p>

<p>
'Prayers?' Lavendale inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Not a bad name for our few minutes' serious
diversion,' Mr. Silburn remarked dryly.
</p>

<p>
Lavendale led Suzanne towards a couch at the
further end of the hall.  He laid his hand upon
hers and found it as cold as ice.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne,' he said quietly, 'are we in a trap?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe we are,' she answered.  'It is
entirely my fault.  I have never been so foolish
before in my life.  I have always had people
behind me who have known my whereabouts
and who could come to the rescue, if necessary.
This time I told no one.  I was selfish.  I
wanted the whole credit.  But tell me of
yourself&mdash;how you came here?'
</p>

<p>
'It was just the merest chance,' he replied.
'Silburn had asked me to shoot here, and then
you half told me where you were, over the
telephone.  I think that the rest must have
been instinct.  You haven't told me yet, though,
how you found your way here?'
</p>

<p>
'I was down at the village,' she said.  'I
followed Mr. Steinletter here.  I had a special
permit, a military pass.  I was supposed to be
related to one of the officers quartered at the
inn.  I made a few inquiries about this place,
which increased my suspicions.  Then I met
Mrs. Silburn outside the lodge gates.  She was
with the Colonel in command here and they
stopped to speak to the officer I was with.  She
was delightful and asked me to call.  I was
only too glad to have a chance of obtaining
the entrée to the house.  They made me send
for my clothes, to spend the night.  That was
two days ago.  Since then I have tried in
vain to get away.'
</p>

<p>
'Let me understand what you mean by
trying to get away?' he begged.  'Surely you
could ask for a car to take you to the station?'
</p>

<p>
'I have done so three times,' she replied,
'always with the same result.  They assure
me that every car in the garage has been
requisitioned by the Government.  I go to that
dummy telephone&mdash;the exchange is in the
house, you know&mdash;and of course nothing
happens.  If I start out to walk, I am shadowed
by one of the men-servants, and, as you know,
it is two miles before one reaches the road.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, there isn't much they can do with
us, dear,' Lavendale assured her coolly.  'Tell me
now, have you made any actual discovery?'
</p>

<p>
'There is a private telegraph and telephone
exchange here in the place,' she said, 'and
Mr. Silburn gets messages every few hours.  There
are people always coming and going, all people
of the same class.  There is not the slightest
doubt that this is the place for which we have
searched.  Ambrose, if only we could stretch
out the net now, at this moment, we could make
a great haul.'
</p>

<p>
'Instead of which,' he remarked grimly,
'we seem to be in the meshes ourselves!'
</p>

<p>
'Tell me,' she begged, 'does any one know
that you were coming here?'
</p>

<p>
'I told Elwell&mdash;Major Elwell,' Lavendale
replied, with a suddenly inspired flash of
memory.  'I told him why I was coming here, too.'
</p>

<p>
She clutched at his arm.  Then suddenly she
looked down.  'They are watching us,' she
whispered.  'Ambrose, that may save us yet
if only he comes in time!'
</p>

<p>
'In time for what?' Lavendale answered
cheerfully.  'I can't look upon this as very
serious, dear.  Why, Lydia Silburn is my own
cousin.'
</p>

<p>
'She is our only hope,' Suzanne declared.
'As for the rest, I have grown to suspect every
one of them.'
</p>

<p>
'What does this half-past ten business mean?'
he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'At half-past ten they all go into what they
call the cloister room,' she said.  'As yet I
have not been invited there, but I have an idea
that to-night we are both to be present.  Yes,
here comes Mr. Silburn.'
</p>

<p>
'Now, you young people,' their host observed
pleasantly, 'we are going to let you into a few
secrets.  This way.'
</p>

<p>
They both rose.  The others were crossing
the hall towards the eastern corridor.
Mr. Silburn drew Suzanne's arm through his.  As
they walked his face became more serious.
Lavendale had a wild idea, for a moment, of
snatching Suzanne away, opening the front
door by force and clamouring for freedom.  Then
he remembered the two miles to the lodge gate
and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'It's rather a queer apartment into which
I am going to take you,' Mr. Silburn explained,
'a crazy sort of place, really, but to us Americans
this sort of room, I must confess, appeals
some.  Allow me, Miss de Freyne.'
</p>

<p>
He motioned them both to precede him.
They found themselves in what seemed to be,
from the bareness of the walls and the shape
of the windows, a small chapel, built on different
levels.  The larger part of the room, which was
below, was wrapped in complete gloom.  The
smaller part was unfurnished save for a long
table, around which was ranged a number of
chairs.  One by one, the guests seated
themselves.  Lavendale and Suzanne followed their
example as indifferently as possible.  Mr. Silburn
sat at the head of the table, with Lady
Marsham on his right and Mr. Steinletter
opposite.  There was a certain significance to
Lavendale in the fact that his cousin was not
present.  A somewhat gloomy light was thrown
upon the faces of the little company from a
heavily-shaded oil lamp suspended by a brass
chain from the roof, and, looking around at their
mingled expressions, Lavendale for the first time
felt a sense of real danger, a thrill of something
like fear, not for his own sake but for Suzanne's.
He groped for her hand beneath the table and
held the icy-cold fingers tightly.
</p>

<p>
'Courage, dear,' he murmured under his breath.
</p>

<p>
She smiled at him plaintively, and with the
fear still lurking in her dark eyes.  Then
Mr. Silburn leaned forward in his place and tapped
upon the table with his forefinger.  His voice
in the hollow spaces sounded strangely.
</p>

<p>
'My friends,' he began, 'few words are best.
We live, as you all know, from day to day in
danger.  No such association as ours could
continue to exist without hourly peril.  So far we
have triumphed over the secret service of every
country.  So far we have carried on our great
work without hindrance or suspicion.  Those days
I am forced to tell you, are passing.  The hour
of our supreme peril is close at hand.  There
are two people here present who have guessed
our secret.  One of them, this young lady upon
my left, Miss de Freyne, is here for no other
purpose than to spy upon us.'
</p>

<p>
Suzanne seemed to have regained her courage.
In the moment of trial she was stronger
than in the indeterminate hours of suspense.
She turned her head towards Silburn.
</p>

<p>
'What are you all but spies,' she demanded,
'spies of the lowest and most dastardly class?
You are here under the shelter of a friendly
country to do her all the harm you can, to
stab in the dark, to take advantage of your
nationality&mdash;your American nationality&mdash;to pose
as an Anglo-Saxon.  You abuse the country
which shelters you.  You call me a spy!
Compared with you, all of you, I am the most
innocent person who ever breathed.'
</p>

<p>
A strange impassivity seemed to be reflected
from all the faces of the little gathering.  Only
in Mr. Kindersley's face there trembled for a
moment some shadow of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
'You have heard the young lady,' Mr. Silburn
continued calmly.  'We come now to
her companion.  Mr. Lavendale, although an
American by birth, has embraced the cause of
this country; doubtless,' he added, with a
little satirical bow, 'for reasons upon which
I will not enlarge.  He has become the ally
of mademoiselle.  We secured his presence
here, I admit, by a ruse.  My friends, these
two people's knowledge of our secret is fatal to
our safety.'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  Then Lady
Marsham leaned back in her chair.
</p>

<p>
'I propose,' she said firmly, 'that the same
steps be taken with these two people as heretofore.'
</p>

<p>
There was a little murmur of approval.
Only Mr. Kindersley sighed.
</p>

<p>
'One must remember,' he observed reflectively,
'that it is not only for our own safety&mdash;it
is for the preservation of a great cause.'
</p>

<p>
Lavendale took a cigarette from a box in
the centre of the table, and lit it.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know what this penalty is that you
propose to inflict upon us,' he remarked, 'but
I should just like to remind you that you are
living in a very highly civilized country, where
people do not disappear.'
</p>

<p>
'At Hookam,' Mr. Silburn said calmly,
'people have disappeared for the last nine
hundred years.  Below there, the secret cloisters
reach almost to the sea.  The cleverest and
most astute criminologists who ever breathed
might track you to these doors, Lavendale,
and search until their hair was grey before they
discovered a single trace of you.  My servants
are mine, body and soul.  For my wife's sake,
Lavendale&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Look here,' Lavendale interrupted, 'I am
not sure whether you are in earnest or not,
but whatever you might be thinking about for
me, you couldn't be such brutes&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
He stopped short.  There was a sudden light
in his face.  From outside the door they could
clearly hear the sound of an angry voice.  A
little ripple of terrified excitement flashed around
the table.  Mr. Silburn's teeth came together
with a little click.  There was a curious tremor
of emotion in his tone.
</p>

<p>
'Lock the door,' he ordered Barracombe.
</p>

<p>
It was too late.  In a long travelling ulster,
with his cap still in his hand, Major Elwell stood
already upon the threshold.  Behind him, still
protesting, was Lydia Silburn.
</p>

<p>
'Elwell!' Lavendale shouted.  'Thank God!'
</p>

<p>
Major Elwell gazed around at them all through
his eye-glass and looked back at the woman by
his side.  He seemed bewildered.
</p>

<p>
'What in the name of all that's holy is this?'
he demanded.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  Lavendale
drew a long breath.  His arm was stretched
out accusingly towards his host.  Suddenly
the words failed upon his lips.  He looked around
him, speechless, amazed.  It was as though the
whole world had gone mad.  Mr. Barracombe,
from the opposite side of the table, had removed
his spectacles from his nose and was wiping the
tears from his eyes.  Lady Marsham was leaning
on one side, doubled up.  There was only
one common sound everywhere&mdash;laughter,
irresistible, compelling, unmistakable.  Mr. Silburn,
taking off his pince-nez and struggling for
composure, rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'The sentence of the court upon you two,'
he declared unsteadily, 'would have been
delivered with more solemnity but for the
premature arrival of our friend Jack Elwell.  I
hereby pronounce it, however, finally and
irrevocably.  It is this, Ambrose Lavendale&mdash;that
you offer your arm to Miss de Freyne, that
you lead the way in to supper, and that you
produce your marriage certificate within three weeks.'
</p>

<p>
Almost as he spoke, lights flashed out from
the great room below.  A long table was laid
for supper.  There were servants who seemed
to appear like magic, with bottles and dishes.
Lavendale turned towards Elwell, looked back
at his host and finally down at Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
'Suzanne,' he exclaimed, 'I believe we're
spoofed!'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  There were tears of
relief in her eyes, but a delicious curve of
laughter upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
'I do not know the word,' she admitted,
'but I believe it is true.'
</p>

<p>
'Lead the way, young fellow,' Mr. Silburn
insisted.  'Forgive us, you two, but when we
heard of Miss de Freyne down at the village,
making inquiries about us&mdash;well, you remember
I had to leave Harvard for a practical joke!'
</p>

<p>
'All the same,' Lydia Silburn declared
from the background, 'the sentence of the
court is final.'
</p>

<p>
They took their places, and the supper party
very soon became a much gayer meal than the
dinner which had preceded it.  Towards its
close, Lavendale whispered to Suzanne.
</p>

<p>
'Dear,' he said, 'I'm afraid we'll have to
own up that we haven't been quite as astute as
usual.  Perhaps we are getting a little stale.
Supposing we take&mdash;a holiday?'
</p>

<p>
She flashed a wonderful smile up at him.
</p>

<p>
'It was the sentence of the court,' she murmured.
</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
